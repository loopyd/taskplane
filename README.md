# Taskplane

Multi-agent AI orchestration for [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) — parallel task execution with checkpoint discipline, fresh-context worker loops, cross-model reviews, and automated merges.

> **Status:** Experimental / Early — APIs and config formats may change between releases.

## What It Does

Taskplane turns your coding project into an AI-managed task board. You define tasks as structured markdown files. Taskplane's agents execute them autonomously — one at a time with `/task`, or many in parallel with `/orch`.

### Key Features

- **Task Runner** (`/task`) — Autonomous single-task execution. Workers run in fresh-context loops with STATUS.md as persistent memory. Every checkbox gets a git checkpoint. Cross-model reviewers catch what the worker missed.
- **Task Orchestrator** (`/orch`) — Parallel multi-task execution using git worktrees for full filesystem isolation. Dependency-aware wave scheduling. Automated merges with conflict resolution.
- **Web Dashboard** — Live browser-based monitoring via `taskplane dashboard`. SSE streaming, lane/task progress, wave visualization, batch history.
- **Structured Tasks** — PROMPT.md defines the mission, steps, and constraints. STATUS.md tracks progress. Agents follow the plan, not vibes.
- **Checkpoint Discipline** — Every completed checkbox item triggers a git commit. Work is never lost, even if a worker crashes mid-task.
- **Cross-Model Review** — Reviewer agent uses a different model than the worker. Independent quality gate before merge.

## Install

Taskplane is a [pi package](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) ≥ 20 and [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) installed first.

### Option A: Global Install (all projects)

```bash
pi install npm:taskplane
```

### Option B: Project-Local Install (recommended for teams)

```bash
cd my-project
pi install -l npm:taskplane
```

Then scaffold your project:

```bash
taskplane init
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
taskplane doctor
```

## Quickstart

### 1. Initialize a project

```bash
cd my-project
taskplane init --preset full
```

This creates config files in `.pi/`, agent prompts, and two example tasks.

### 2. Launch the dashboard (recommended)

In a separate terminal:

```bash
taskplane dashboard
```

Opens a live web dashboard at `http://localhost:8099` with real-time batch monitoring.

### 3. Run your first orchestration

```bash
pi
```

Inside the pi session:

```
/orch-plan all     # Preview waves, lanes, and dependencies
/orch all          # Execute all pending tasks in parallel
/orch-status       # Monitor batch progress
```

The default scaffold includes two independent example tasks, so `/orch all` gives you an immediate orchestrator + dashboard experience.

### 4. Optional: run one task directly

`/task` is still useful for single-task execution and focused debugging:

```
/task taskplane-tasks/EXAMPLE-001-hello-world/PROMPT.md
/task-status
```

Important distinction:

- `/task` runs in your **current branch/worktree**.
- `/orch` runs tasks in **isolated worktrees** and merges back.

Because workers checkpoint with git commits, `/task` can capture unrelated local edits if you're changing files in parallel. For safer isolation (even with one task), prefer:

```text
/orch taskplane-tasks/EXAMPLE-001-hello-world/PROMPT.md
```

Orchestrator lanes execute tasks through task-runner under the hood, so `/task` and `/orch` share the same core task execution model.

## Commands

### Pi Session Commands

| Command | Description |

| `/task <path/to/PROMPT.md>` | Execute one task in the current branch/worktree |
| `/task-status` | Show current task progress |
| `/task-pause` | Pause after current worker iteration finishes |
| `/task-resume` | Resume a paused task |
| `/orch <areas\|paths\|all>` | Execute tasks via isolated worktrees (recommended default) |
| `/orch-plan <areas\|paths\|all>` | Preview execution plan without running |
| `/orch-status` | Show batch progress |
| `/orch-pause` | Pause batch after current tasks finish |
| `/orch-resume` | Resume a paused batch |
| `/orch-abort [--hard]` | Abort batch (graceful or immediate) |
| `/orch-deps <areas\|paths\|all>` | Show dependency graph |
| `/orch-sessions` | List active worker sessions |

### CLI Commands

| Command | Description |

**Single task** (`/task`): Worker iterates in fresh-context loops. STATUS.md is persistent memory. Each checkbox → git checkpoint. Reviewer validates on completion.

**Parallel batch** (`/orch`): Tasks are sorted into dependency waves. Each wave runs in parallel across lanes (git worktrees). Completed lanes merge into the integration branch before the next wave starts.
