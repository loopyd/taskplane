# Taskplane Documentation

Welcome to the Taskplane docs.

Taskplane has two core audiences:

1. **Users/Operators** — install Taskplane, run tasks, orchestrate batches
2. **Contributors/Maintainers** — understand internals, test changes, and release updates

> **Status:** Public documentation is available and organized by audience and doc type (tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation).
