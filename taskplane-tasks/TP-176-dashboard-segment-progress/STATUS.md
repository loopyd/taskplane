### Step 1: Segment-Scoped STATUS.md Viewer
**Status:** 🟨 In Progress
- [ ] Client-side: determine active repoId from task/lane segment data; within each step section, keep only the `#### Segment: <repoId>` block matching the active segment (remove non-matching blocks); keep all non-step content (metadata, notes)
- [ ] Add fallback: if multi-segment but segment block cannot be resolved, show full STATUS.md
- [ ] Render segment header context (e.g., "Segment 2/3: shared-libs") in viewer title
- [ ] Preserve full STATUS.md for single-segment tasks (no markers)

---

### Step 2: Segment-Scoped Progress Bar
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] Progress bar uses segment-scoped counts
- [ ] 100% override for succeeded tasks (#491)
