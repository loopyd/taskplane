### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Step 1: Segment-Scoped STATUS.md Viewer
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Client-side: resolve active segmentId → repoId + current step from task/lane data; filter STATUS.md to show only the current segment's `#### Segment: <repoId>` checkbox blocks (across steps that belong to this segment's repoId); remove non-matching segment blocks from other repos
- [x] Add fallback: if multi-segment but segment block cannot be resolved, show full STATUS.md
- [x] Render segment header context (e.g., "Segment 2/3: shared-libs") in viewer title
- [x] Preserve full STATUS.md for single-segment tasks (no markers)
