---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Read dashboard app.js and server.cjs
- [ ] Understand sidecar telemetry data flow

---

### Step 1: Segment-Scoped STATUS.md Viewer
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Client-side: resolve active segmentId → repoId + current step from task/lane data; filter STATUS.md to show only the current segment's `#### Segment: <repoId>` checkbox blocks (across steps that belong to this segment's repoId); remove non-matching segment blocks from other repos
- [ ] Add fallback: if multi-segment but segment block cannot be resolved, show full STATUS.md
- [ ] Render segment header context (e.g., "Segment 2/3: shared-libs") in viewer title
- [ ] Preserve full STATUS.md for single-segment tasks (no markers)

---

### Step 2: Segment-Scoped Progress Bar
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Per-task progress bar uses V2 snapshot segment-scoped counts (already done by TP-174; verify and fix for succeeded tasks)
- [ ] Force 100% for succeeded tasks regardless of statusData/sidecar state (#491)

---

### Step 3: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Run full test suite to verify no regressions
- [ ] Verify JavaScript logic correctness of filterStatusMdForSegment
- [ ] Verify resolveActiveSegmentForTask handles edge cases
- [ ] Verify progress bar #491 fix logic

### Step 4: Documentation & Delivery

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| TP-174 already implemented segment-scoped progress in V2 snapshots (emitSnapshot), so the per-task progress bar was already segment-scoped for running tasks | Verified, no extra code needed | lane-runner.ts emitSnapshot |
| #491 root cause: succeeded tasks with existing statusData fell into the sd/v2p progress branch instead of showing 100% | Fixed: succeeded check moved before sd/v2p check | dashboard/public/app.js |
| filterStatusMdForSegment is pure client-side; no server changes needed | Decision documented | dashboard/public/app.js |

## Notes

Depends on TP-174 (sidecar telemetry reports segment-scoped data).
Also fixes #491 (succeeded tasks show 0% progress).
