### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Read the current skill, prompt template, and AGENTS/config guidance
- [ ] Identify every place the skill still assumes `/task`, TMUX, `PROGRESS.md`, or YAML-first config behavior

---

### Step 1: Update Skill Workflow and Guidance
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Switch the skill guidance to JSON config precedence while preserving fallback notes only where necessary
- [ ] Replace `/task` launch/reporting guidance with `/orch`-based execution guidance
- [ ] Remove TMUX-centric phrasing from the skill's architecture and workflow sections
- [ ] Remove `PROGRESS.md` as a required tracking artifact for this project/workflow

---

### Step 2: Update Templates and References
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Refresh the prompt/status template language so it does not imply `/task` is the canonical runtime path
- [ ] Align command references, task-creation checklists, and examples with Runtime V2/V3 direction
- [ ] Review user-facing docs touched by the skill for consistency

---

### Step 3: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Verify markdown links and file references in the updated skill and templates
- [ ] Run CI and confirm green
- [ ] Full suite verification remained green in PR validation

---

### Step 4: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Document deliberate compatibility wording where fallback behavior remains
- [ ] Log discoveries in STATUS.md

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Snake_case config keys in skill text could conflict with canonical JSON guidance | Updated to canonical `taskRunner.*` keys with explicit legacy alias notes | `skills/create-taskplane-task/SKILL.md` |
| Stale `/task` launch wording remained in hydration section | Reworded to execution-engine launch semantics | `skills/create-taskplane-task/SKILL.md` |
| Template still credited task-runner for runtime artifacts | Updated to orchestrator/execution-engine wording | `skills/create-taskplane-task/references/prompt-template.md` |

## Execution Log

| Timestamp | Action | Outcome |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| 2026-03-30 | Task staged | PROMPT.md and STATUS.md created |
| 2026-03-31 | Initial implementation | Skill updated to `/orch`, JSON-first, no PROGRESS.md requirement |
| 2026-04-01 | Supervisor review | Identified remaining canonical-key and stale wording gaps |
| 2026-04-01 | Supervisor direct patch | Final terminology/config-key alignment landed |

## Notes

TP-101 is complete; skill guidance now reflects orchestrator-first execution and canonical JSON config semantics with explicit fallback aliases.
