### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** 🟨 In Progress
- [x] Read PROMPT.md and STATUS.md
- [x] Read review_step in bridge extension
- [x] Read onTelemetry callback in lane-runner
- [x] Read dashboard reviewer sub-row rendering
- [x] Read V2 snapshot → laneStates synthesis

### Step 1: Bridge extension — write reviewer telemetry to file
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [x] Parse reviewer stdout for RPC events
- [x] Accumulate telemetry (tokens, cost, tools, elapsed)
- [x] Write to .reviewer-state.json on each message_end
- [x] Write final state on exit
- [x] Cleanup after reading output

### Step 2: Lane-runner — read reviewer state into snapshot
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [x] Add snapshot refresh path independent of worker message_end cadence
- [x] Check for .reviewer-state.json in onTelemetry callback
- [x] Populate snapshot.reviewer when running
- [x] Set null when absent or done

### Step 3: Dashboard server — reviewer in laneStates synthesis
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [x] Map snap.reviewer to legacy reviewer format
- [x] Ensure frontend rendering activates

### Step 4: Dashboard frontend — verify reviewer sub-row
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [x] Verify reviewerActive check works with V2 data
- [x] Adjust if needed
- [x] Test appearance/disappearance

### Step 5: Tests
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] Test: reviewer data in snapshot → correct dashboard state
- [ ] Test: no reviewer-state → null
- [ ] Run full suite
- [ ] Fix failures

### Step 6: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] Update STATUS.md
- [ ] Log discoveries

## Notes

- Reviewer suggestion (R003): treat reviewer-state read/parse errors as best-effort and keep reviewer agentId generation on `buildRuntimeAgentId(..., "reviewer")`.
