---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] Understand spawnAgentTmux() pattern in task-runner.ts (RPC wrapper, sidecar, exit summary)
- [ ] Understand buildTmuxSpawnArgs() in execution.ts (current lane spawn)
- [ ] Understand spawnMergeAgent() in merge.ts (current merge spawn)
- [ ] Understand parseTelemetryFilename() in dashboard/server.cjs
- [ ] Understand rpc-wrapper.mjs CLI interface
- [ ] Verify resolveRpcWrapperPath() accessibility

---

### Step 1: Route lane worker spawns through RPC wrapper
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

> ⚠️ Hydrate: Expand based on exact command structure discovered in Step 0

- [ ] Update buildTmuxSpawnArgs() to spawn node rpc-wrapper.mjs instead of pi directly
- [ ] Generate telemetry file paths with dashboard-compatible naming
- [ ] Ensure env vars (TASK_AUTOSTART, etc.) still passed correctly
- [ ] Ensure -e task-runner.ts extension still loaded

---

### Step 2: Route merge agent spawns through RPC wrapper
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] Update spawnMergeAgent() to spawn via RPC wrapper
- [ ] Generate merge-specific telemetry file paths
- [ ] Preserve existing merge agent CLI args (system prompt, prompt file)

---

### Step 3: Route reviewer spawns through RPC wrapper (tmux mode)
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] Verify reviewer tmux spawn uses RPC wrapper in doReview()
- [ ] If not, update to use spawnAgentTmux() pattern
- [ ] Verify reviewer telemetry files produced with recognizable names

---

### Step 4: Ensure dashboard consumes all telemetry sources
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] Verify parseTelemetryFilename() handles worker, merger, reviewer files
- [ ] Update parser if naming convention doesn't match
- [ ] Verify dashboard displays telemetry for all agent types

---

### Step 5: Testing & Verification
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Tests for lane spawn command includes rpc-wrapper
- [ ] Tests for merge spawn command includes rpc-wrapper
- [ ] Tests for telemetry filename generation
- [ ] Tests for dashboard filename parser coverage

---

### Step 6: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] Check affected docs
- [ ] Discoveries logged
- [ ] `.DONE` created
