### Step 0: Preflight and Analysis
**Status:** ✅ Done

- [x] Read waves.ts wave planning logic for multi-segment tasks
- [x] Reproduce excessive-waves scenario (8 tasks → 5 waves instead of 3)
- [x] Read `enforceGlobalLaneCap` and trace call sites
- [x] Identify root cause of phantom waves
- [x] Identify per-repo vs global maxLanes gap
- [x] Document findings in STATUS.md

### Step 1: Fix Excessive Wave Generation
**Status:** 🟨 In Progress

- [ ] Modify `buildSegmentFrontierWaves` to not pre-expand waves into segment rounds (return task-level waves, let continuation mechanism handle segment advancement)
- [ ] Track task-level wave count separately from segment rounds — store `taskLevelWaveCount` on batchState
- [ ] Update wave messages to use task-level wave count for the "of N" display
- [ ] Run targeted tests: waves*.test.ts

---

### Step 2: Fix Global Lane Cap Enforcement
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

> ⚠️ Hydrate: Expand based on analysis in Step 0

- [ ] Ensure `enforceGlobalLaneCap` is effective in workspace path
- [ ] Add test: 3 repos, maxLanes=4 → total ≤ 4
- [ ] Run targeted tests

---

### Step 3: Testing & Verification
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] FULL test suite passing
- [ ] Regression test: correct wave count for small graphs
- [ ] Regression test: global lane cap enforcement
- [ ] All failures fixed

---

### Step 4: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] Update maxLanes docs
- [ ] Discoveries logged

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Phantom waves root cause: `buildSegmentFrontierWaves` (engine.ts ~1093) pre-expands each task-level wave into N segment rounds (N = max segments per task in wave). 3 task-level waves → 5 segment rounds when workspace tasks touch 2 repos. | Fix in Step 1 | engine.ts:1093 |
| `enforceGlobalLaneCap` IS correctly wired at waves.ts:1295 in `allocateLanes`. 12 per-repo lanes → 4 after cap. Verified via test. | Already working | waves.ts:998,1295 |
| `computeWaveAssignments` (used for /orch-deps display) doesn't do repo-grouping or global cap — treats all tasks as one flat group. Display-only issue; execution is correct. | Out of scope — display | waves.ts:1501 |
