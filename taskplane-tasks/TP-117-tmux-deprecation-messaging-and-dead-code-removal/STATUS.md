### Step 4: Tests
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Update tests for removed functions
- [ ] Run full suite

## Step 0 Inventory (Dead TMUX Paths)

### Execution (`extensions/taskplane/execution.ts`)
- `executeLane()` is legacy-only. It is selected only via `executeWave(..., runtimeBackend)` legacy branch, but `selectRuntimeBackend()` in `engine.ts` now always returns `"v2"`.
- `spawnLaneSession()` is legacy-only; it is called from `executeLane()` and legacy resume branches.
- `buildTmuxSpawnArgs()` is legacy-only; it is called by `spawnLaneSession()`.
- Additional legacy-only helpers tied to the TMUX lane path: `pollUntilTaskComplete()`, `resolveLaneLogPath()`, `resolveLaneLogRelativePath()`, `readLaneLogTailAsync()`, `captureTmuxPaneTailAsync()`, `readTaskStatusTailAsync()`, `buildLaneEnvVars()`, `generateTelemetryPaths()`.

### Merge (`extensions/taskplane/merge.ts`)
- `spawnMergeAgent()` is the TMUX merge spawner (legacy path); `spawnMergeAgentV2()` is the active path under V2.
- `generateMergeTelemetryPaths()` is only used by legacy `spawnMergeAgent()`.
- `merge.ts` currently has dead legacy import drift from execution.ts: `buildLaneEnvVars`, `buildTmuxSpawnArgs`, and `generateTelemetryPaths` are imported but unused.

### Sessions (`extensions/taskplane/sessions.ts`)
- No dead session helper exports found: `listOrchSessions()` and `formatOrchSessions()` are still used by `/orch-sessions` and engine cleanup checks.
- Non-functional cleanup candidate: unused `join` import in `sessions.ts`.

## Completion Summary

- Updated stale legacy-TMUX test assertions across five files to align with Runtime V2 entry points (`executeLaneV2`, `spawnMergeAgentV2`) and removed assertions for deleted helpers.
- Removed obsolete structural checks in `crash-recovery-spawn-reliability.test.ts` that referenced `buildTmuxSpawnArgs`.
- Validation coverage:
  - Targeted tests: `orch-rpc-telemetry`, `runtime-model-fallback`, `supervisor-merge-monitoring`, `workspace-config.integration`, `crash-recovery-spawn-reliability`
  - Full suite: **3398 passed, 0 failed**

## Discoveries

- Unexpected residual references to removed TMUX functions were limited to structural tests; no production code import sites remained after Steps 2–3.
- `merge.ts` health-monitor flow still deregisters sessions via `healthMonitor.removeSession(...)`, but no longer registers with `healthMonitor.addSession(...)` in the Runtime V2 merge path.
