### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Trace the current rpc-wrapper responsibilities and identify which belong in a Runtime V2 host versus higher-level runtime code
- [ ] Define the manifest, registry, and normalized event flow before cutting code

---

### Step 1: Implement Process Registry and Manifests
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Create the runtime registry and per-agent manifest helpers
- [ ] Persist enough metadata to replace TMUX-based liveness and cleanup checks
- [ ] Define deterministic state transitions for running, wrapping up, exited, crashed, timed out, and killed agents

---

### Step 2: Implement Direct Agent Host
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Implement or evolve the host so it spawns `pi --mode rpc` directly with `shell: false` and no TMUX dependency
- [ ] Normalize RPC events into durable per-agent event logs and parent-facing updates
- [ ] Preserve mailbox inbox delivery and exit summaries on the new host

---

### Step 3: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Add or update behavioral tests for direct-child hosting, registry lifecycle, normalized event persistence, and mailbox delivery
- [ ] Run the full suite (3215 pass, 0 fail)
- [ ] Fix all failures

---

### Step 4: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Update Runtime V2 docs if host/registry naming differs from plan
- [ ] Log discoveries in STATUS.md

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| rpc-wrapper.mjs pure functions (applyEvent, buildExitSummary, checkMailboxAndSteer) are reusable — agent-host reimplements the pattern directly rather than importing the .mjs file | Clean separation; rpc-wrapper stays for legacy TMUX path during migration | extensions/taskplane/agent-host.ts |
| Pi CLI on Windows must be spawned via node cli.js, not pi.CMD | resolvePiCliPath() handles this for both platforms | extensions/taskplane/agent-host.ts |
| stdin close delay of >=100ms after agent_end prevents Windows assertion failures | closeDelayMs parameter with 100ms default | extensions/taskplane/agent-host.ts |
