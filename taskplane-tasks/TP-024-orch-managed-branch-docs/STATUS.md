## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `.pi/local/docs/orch-managed-branch-spec.md` referenced in PROMPT context does not exist | Non-blocking — derived behavior from source code (extension.ts, engine.ts, types.ts, messages.ts) | PROMPT.md Tier 3 context |
| commands.md: `/orch-integrate` goes after `/orch-sessions` in Orchestrator Commands section | Input for Step 1 | docs/reference/commands.md |
| taskplane-settings.md: Integration setting missing from Orchestrator table (6 settings currently, need 7th) | Input for Step 2 | docs/reference/configuration/taskplane-settings.md |
| README.md: Pi Session Commands table has 13 rows, `/orch-integrate` needs to be added | Input for Step 3 | README.md |
| architecture.md: Merge flow description is generic; needs update to mention orch branch model and user integration | Input for Step 3 | docs/explanation/architecture.md |
