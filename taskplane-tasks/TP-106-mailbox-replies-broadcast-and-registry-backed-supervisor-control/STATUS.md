### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Review current mailbox implementation and identify which assumptions are session/TMUX-specific rather than agent-ID/registry-based
- [ ] Trace the current supervisor tools (`send_agent_message`, `list_active_agents`, `read_agent_status`) and outline the Runtime V2 source of truth for each

---

### Step 1: Registry-Backed Supervisor Tools
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Rework supervisor-facing agent tools to validate and resolve against the runtime registry instead of TMUX
- [ ] Preserve familiar agent IDs while severing the assumption that they are terminal/session names
- [ ] Ensure delivery and liveness errors are surfaced from registry/runtime state, not terminal state

---

### Step 2: Agent Replies, Broadcast, and Rate Limiting
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Implement agent→supervisor replies/escalations on the new runtime flow
- [ ] Implement broadcast and per-agent rate limiting on top of the mailbox model
- [ ] Keep auditability intact for sent, delivered, replied, and rate-limited messages

---

### Step 3: Bridge Contact Tools
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Add minimal agent-side bridge/contact tools for reply/escalate flows where generic file writes would be brittle
- [ ] Document how these tools fit with future review and segment-expansion bridge work

---

### Step 4: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Add or update behavioral tests for registry-backed tool behavior, reply flow, broadcast, and rate limiting
- [ ] Run the full suite (3312 pass, 0 fail)
- [ ] Fix all failures

---

### Step 5: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Update mailbox and command docs for the new Runtime V2 control model
- [ ] Log discoveries in STATUS.md
