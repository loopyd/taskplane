---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Read `doOrchStart()` in `extension.ts`
- [ ] Read the `/taskplane-settings` `onConfigChanged` callback
- [ ] Read the `session_start` handler
- [ ] Verify test baseline (pre-existing failure: test 5.11 in workspace-config.integration.test.ts — fragile char-index check, unrelated to this task)

---

### Step 1: Add config reload at the top of doOrchStart()
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Implement reload block before the execCtx guard
- [ ] Phase guard: skip reload during active batch
- [ ] Verify atomic assignment pattern matches settings reload

---

### Step 2: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Full test suite passing (206/207 pass; 1 pre-existing failure: test 5.11 fragile char-index check, present before this change)
- [ ] CLI smoke passing
- [ ] Fix all failures (none introduced by this change)

---

### Step 3: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Inline comment explaining the reload (references TP-158, issue #460, and the guard rationale)
- [ ] Discoveries logged

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Test 5.11 in workspace-config.integration.test.ts was already failing before this task. It uses `indexOf("session_start")` which finds a comment at ~line 3476 instead of the actual handler. The first `buildExecutionContext` found after that is the one in the settings handler (~line 4732), not in `session_start` (~line 4777). The `execCtx = null` at ~4773 thus fails `resetIdx < buildIdx`. Pre-existing bug in the test. | Out of scope — logged for awareness | extensions/tests/workspace-config.integration.test.ts:747 |
