### Step 0: Preflight and Root Cause Analysis
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Read engine.ts segment lifecycle: how `.DONE` is created after task completion
- [ ] Read task-executor-core.ts / lane-runner.ts: where `.DONE` is written
- [ ] Read engine.ts `processSegmentExpansionRequestAtBoundary` and its call site
- [ ] Identify exact condition causing premature .DONE
- [ ] Identify why expansion requests are not consumed
- [ ] Document findings in STATUS.md

**Findings:**

**Bug #1 — Premature .DONE creation (lane-runner.ts:739-742):**
The lane-runner determines `isNonFinalSegment` by checking `unit.task.segmentIds[last] !== segmentId`. For dynamically-expanding tasks (start with 1 segment, worker files expansion request), `segmentIds.length === 1`, so `isNonFinalSegment` evaluates to false and .DONE is created prematurely. The engine's safety-net .DONE removal at engine.ts:2688-2698 uses `task.packetTaskPath || task.taskFolder` which resolves to a different path than the worktree where .DONE was actually written. Additionally, once .DONE is committed to git and merged, it propagates to subsequent worktrees.

**Bug #2 — Expansion request consumption (engine.ts:2600 + resolveTaskWorkerAgentId):**
The `resolveTaskWorkerAgentId` function falls back to `lane.laneSessionId` (e.g., `orch-henry-lane-1`) when the outcome's sessionName is absent. The actual outbox is under the WORKER agent ID (`orch-henry-lane-1-worker`). When the fallback triggers, the engine looks in the wrong directory and finds no expansion files. Additionally, the engine's .DONE removal path after expansion approval uses the wrong (non-worktree) path.

### Step 1: Fix Premature .DONE Creation
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Add outbox expansion-request check in lane-runner before .DONE creation — suppress .DONE if pending requests exist
- [ ] Fix engine .DONE removal safety net to use worktree-resolved path (via laneByTaskId)
- [ ] Run targeted tests

---

### Step 2: Fix Segment Expansion Consumption
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Fix `resolveTaskWorkerAgentId` fallback: append `-worker` role to `lane.laneSessionId` so outbox lookup uses correct agent ID
- [ ] Verify `.processed` renaming already works (markSegmentExpansionRequestFile call at line ~2724)
- [ ] Add test for `resolveTaskWorkerAgentId` returning correct worker agent ID
- [ ] Run targeted tests

---

### Step 3: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] FULL test suite passing (3268 tests, 0 failures)
- [ ] Regression test: multi-segment .DONE guard (5 tests in segment-boundary-done-guard.test.ts)
- [ ] Regression test: expansion request consumption (3 tests + 6 tests in segment-expansion-engine.test.ts)
- [ ] All failures fixed (none found)

---

### Step 4: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Docs reviewed for segment lifecycle references (no updates needed — internal engine behavior)
- [ ] Discoveries logged

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `laneSessionId` vs worker agent ID diverge in workspace mode (repo-scoped local numbering vs global) | Fixed: `resolveTaskWorkerAgentId` now uses `agentIdPrefix` + global `laneNumber` | `engine.ts:150-175` |
| Engine .DONE safety-net used `task.packetTaskPath` (workspace root path) instead of worktree-resolved path | Fixed: uses `resolveCanonicalTaskPaths` with lane worktree | `engine.ts:2690-2712` |
| `syncTaskOutcomesFromMonitor` preserves existing `sessionName` (no overwrite risk) | Verified | `persistence.ts:189+` |
