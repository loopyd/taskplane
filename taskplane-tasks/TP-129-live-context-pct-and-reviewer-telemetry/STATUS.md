**Current Step:** None
**Status:** Pending
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-03
**Review Level:** 1
**Review Counter:** 0
**Iteration:** 1
**Size:** M

---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Read PROMPT.md and STATUS.md
- [ ] Read agent-host.ts get_session_stats handling
- [ ] Read dashboard reviewer sub-row rendering
- [ ] Document worker row telemetry fields

### Step 1: Periodic context % refresh
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Replace single statsRequested with periodic requests
- [ ] Keep immediate first get_session_stats request on first assistant message_end
- [ ] Send follow-up get_session_stats on a bounded cadence (every 5 assistant message_end events)
- [ ] Verify response handler updates contextUsage
- [ ] Benefits both worker and reviewer

### Step 2: Full reviewer telemetry in dashboard
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Add elapsed time to reviewer sub-row
- [ ] Add token summary to reviewer sub-row
- [ ] Add context % to reviewer sub-row
- [ ] Verify badge layout matches worker row

### Step 3: Tests
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Test: initial immediate stats request is preserved and periodic follow-ups occur at bounded cadence
- [ ] Run full suite
- [ ] Fix failures

### Step 4: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Update STATUS.md

## Notes

- Worker row telemetry fields in `dashboard/public/app.js` (task row rendering):
  - `⏱` elapsed from `workerElapsed`
  - `🔧` tool calls from `workerToolCount`
  - `📊` context percent from `workerContextPct`
  - `🪙` token summary from `workerInputTokens + workerCacheReadTokens` (input), `workerOutputTokens` (output), and optional `workerCostUsd`
  - Last tool text from `workerLastTool` (or `[awaiting review]` when reviewer active)
  - Retry/compaction badges from telemetry sidecar (`retryActive`/`retries`, `compactions`)
- Plan review suggestion noted: prefer deterministic turn-based cadence over timers for easier testability and lower edge-case risk.
- Reviewer `📊` context badge already existed; parity update retained it in the same `worker-stat` badge layout while adding missing elapsed/token badges.

## Completion Summary

- `extensions/taskplane/agent-host.ts`: replaced one-shot `statsRequested` flow with periodic `get_session_stats` requests (first assistant message + every 5 assistant `message_end` events).
- `dashboard/public/app.js`: upgraded reviewer sub-row to worker-style telemetry badges with elapsed (`⏱`), token summary (`🪙`), context (`📊`), tool count (`🔧`), and last tool.
- `extensions/tests/process-registry.test.ts`: added structural test (`9.8`) asserting immediate + bounded-cadence stats request behavior.
- Verification: full suite passed (`3120` passed, `0` failed).
