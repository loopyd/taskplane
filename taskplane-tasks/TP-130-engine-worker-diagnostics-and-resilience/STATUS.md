---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Read PROMPT.md and STATUS.md
- [x] Read engine-worker.ts error handling
- [x] Read extension.ts fork + exit handler
- [x] Read lane-runner.ts reviewerRefresh

### Step 1: Process-level error handlers
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Add uncaughtException handler with IPC error + stack
- [x] Add unhandledRejection handler
- [x] Ensure IPC reaches parent before exit

### Step 2: Stderr capture
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Pipe child stderr to batch-scoped file
- [x] Tee to parent stderr for terminal display
- [x] Include stderr tail in failure alert

### Step 3: Snapshot failure counter
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Add non-throwing emitSnapshot success/failure signal
- [x] Add consecutive failure counter
- [x] Disable interval after 5 failures
- [x] Reset on success

### Step 4: Tests
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Test: uncaughtException handler exists
- [x] Test: unhandledRejection handler exists
- [x] Test: stderr capture + failure alert tail wiring exists
- [x] Test: snapshot failure threshold + reset wiring exists
- [x] Run full suite
- [x] Fix failures

### Step 5: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** 🟨 In Progress
- [ ] Update STATUS.md

## Notes

- Reviewer R003 suggestion: include lane/task + consecutive failure count in disable warning.
- Reviewer R003 suggestion: add targeted threshold behavior test (failure threshold + success reset).
- Reviewer R005 suggestion: keep additional coverage lightweight via source/contract tests in existing files.
