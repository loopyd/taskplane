### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** 🟨 In Progress
- [x] Read PROMPT.md and STATUS.md
- [x] Verify TP-140 complete
- [x] Read init flow and model discovery
- [x] Read thinking picker
- [x] Check pi --list-models format

### Step 1: First-install detection and global prefs bootstrap
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [x] Detect missing prefs file → bootstrap from schema defaults
- [x] Default thinking to "high" for all agents
- [x] Return bootstrap flag for downstream guidance
- [x] Atomic write (temp + rename)
- [x] Handle empty/corrupt prefs
- [x] Run targeted tests

### Step 2: Cross-provider model guidance in first init
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [x] Detect first-init condition
- [x] Query models, count providers
- [x] 2+ providers: show guidance + cross-provider picker
- [x] 1 provider: skip with info message
- [x] Save to global prefs
- [x] Skip on subsequent inits
- [x] Run targeted tests

### Step 3: Thinking level picker enhancement
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [x] Settings TUI: all pi levels (off→xhigh) + inherit
- [x] CLI init: same levels
- [x] Default selection: high
- [x] Thinking column from pi --list-models
- [x] Unsupported-thinking models: show info note only (do not block selection)
- [x] Add targeted test for unsupported-thinking permissive behavior
- [x] Run targeted tests

### Step 4: Testing & Verification
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] Full test suite passing
- [ ] Bootstrap creates prefs with thinking: high
- [ ] No re-bootstrap on existing prefs
- [ ] Cross-provider guidance triggers correctly
- [ ] Thinking picker shows all levels
- [ ] Single-provider skips guidance
- [ ] CLI smoke tests
- [ ] All failures fixed

### Step 5: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] Update config docs
- [ ] Update README if needed
- [ ] Document bootstrap behavior
- [ ] Update STATUS.md

## Notes

*Reserved for execution notes*
- Review R005 suggestion (advisory): add compatibility coverage for legacy `on`/`off` values mapping to level-based thinking defaults.
- Review R005 suggestion (advisory): add parser-hardening coverage for `pi --list-models` thinking column spacing/order variance.
