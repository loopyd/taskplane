# TP-094: Context Pressure and Telemetry Accuracy Fix — Status

**Current Step:** None
**Status:** Pending
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-29
**Review Level:** 2
**Review Counter:** 0
**Iteration:** 4
**Size:** M

---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Verify field name mismatch in real sidecar data
- [ ] Trace all percentUsed code paths
- [ ] Identify manual fallback removal points

---

### Step 1: Fix field name mismatch in sidecar tailing
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] 1a. Type: renamed `percentUsed` → `percent` in `SidecarTelemetryDelta.contextUsage`
- [ ] 1b. Parser: reads `cu.percent ?? cu.percentUsed` for backward compat
- [ ] 1c. Worker consumer: updated to `.percent`
- [ ] 1d. Reviewer consumers (both paths): updated to `.percent`
- [ ] 1e. Manual token fallback removed from worker + both reviewer paths
- [ ] 1f. One-shot warning: gated on `sawStatsResponseWithoutContextUsage` flag (not hadEvents)
- [ ] 1g. rpc-wrapper verified: passes through correctly, no changes needed

---

### Step 2: Context % snapshots at iteration boundaries
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Write JSONL snapshot at worker iteration end (`writeContextSnapshot()` after `runWorker()`)
- [ ] Add to batch artifact cleanup (post-integrate + preflight age sweep)

---

### Step 3: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Tests updated: `percent` field extracted correctly from real pi response format
- [ ] Tests added: backward-compatible `percentUsed` fallback works
- [ ] Tests added: `percent` takes precedence over `percentUsed`
- [ ] Tests added: `sawStatsResponseWithoutContextUsage` flag behavior
- [ ] 240 targeted tests pass (sidecar, rpc-wrapper, cleanup, reviewer context)
- [ ] 37 state persistence tests pass

---

### Step 4: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Log discoveries in STATUS.md
- [ ] Inline comments updated (TP-094 references in all changed locations)
- [ ] No external doc updates needed (resilience-architecture.md doesn't reference field names)

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Pi sends `contextUsage.percent` but code checks `cu.percentUsed` — always undefined | Fix in Step 1 | `extensions/task-runner.ts:1509` |
| 6 locations reference `.percentUsed` in task-runner.ts: L1374 (type), L1509-1511 (sidecar parse), L2466, L2673 (reviewer), L3302 (worker onTelemetry) | Fix all in Step 1 | `extensions/task-runner.ts` |
| Manual fallback `(delta.latestTotalTokens / contextWindow) * 100` at L3303-3305 and L2468-2469, L2675-2676 (reviewer) | Remove in Step 1 | `extensions/task-runner.ts` |
| rpc-wrapper passes through `event.data.contextUsage` unmodified — field name is `percent` from pi, correct passthrough | No change needed | `bin/rpc-wrapper.mjs:426` |
| Tests in sidecar-tailing.test.ts use `percentUsed` in test data (wrong field) | Fix in Step 3 | `extensions/tests/sidecar-tailing.test.ts` |
