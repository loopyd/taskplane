# TP-134: Segment-Aware Lane Execution — Status

**Current Step:** None
**Status:** Pending
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-03
**Review Level:** 2
**Review Counter:** 0
**Iteration:** 1
**Size:** M

---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Read PROMPT.md and STATUS.md
- [ ] Trace ExecutionUnit flow
- [ ] Identify path derivation points

### Step 1: Propagate segmentId
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Pass segmentId to emitSnapshot
- [ ] Include in lane snapshots
- [ ] Include in telemetry/outcomes

### Step 2: Separate execution cwd from packet paths
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Worker cwd from segment repo worktree
- [ ] STATUS/PROMPT from packet paths
- [ ] .DONE from packet.donePath
- [ ] .reviews from packet.reviewsDir
- [ ] Reviewer state in packet task folder

### Step 3: Worker prompt context
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Include execution repo + packet home context
- [ ] Worker knows repo and packet locations
- [ ] Include segment DAG info if available

### Step 4: Tests
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Test repo-singleton unchanged
- [ ] Test segment cwd correct
- [ ] Test packet paths in packet home
- [ ] Test snapshots include segmentId
- [ ] Run full suite, fix failures

### Step 5: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Update STATUS.md
