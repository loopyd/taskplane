### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Trace the current task/lane runtime contracts through engine, execution, and resume
- [ ] Identify where packet paths, runtime identity, and live artifacts are currently implicit or TMUX-derived

---

### Step 1: Define Runtime V2 Contracts
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Add ExecutionUnit, packet-path, registry manifest, and normalized event type contracts to `types.ts`
- [ ] Add validation helpers and naming rules that preserve repo/workspace correctness
- [ ] Document compatibility shims where legacy task/lane records still need to coexist during migration

---

### Step 2: Thread Contracts into Orchestrator Interfaces
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Update engine/execution/resume signatures to accept explicit packet-path and runtime identity data where needed
- [ ] Add helper functions for resolving runtime artifact roots without TMUX/session assumptions
- [ ] Ensure new contracts are additive and do not yet force the full backend cutover

---

### Step 3: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Add or update behavioral tests covering ExecutionUnit shape, packet-path authority precedence, and runtime artifact naming
- [ ] Run the full suite (3185 pass, 0 fail)
- [ ] Fix all failures

---

### Step 4: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Update the Runtime V2 docs if implementation naming diverges from the spec suite
- [ ] Log discoveries in STATUS.md

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Implementation naming matches spec suite exactly — no doc divergence needed | No action | extensions/taskplane/types.ts |
| resolveCanonicalTaskPaths already handles cross-repo packet paths via archive fallback; bridge wraps it cleanly | Leverage existing logic | extensions/taskplane/execution.ts |
| v4/TP-081 fields (packetRepoId, packetTaskPath, activeSegmentId) on ParsedTask are already partially present — ExecutionUnit formalizes the contract these fields point toward | Thread through lane-runner in TP-105 | extensions/taskplane/types.ts |

## Execution Log

| Timestamp | Action | Outcome |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| 2026-03-30 | Task staged | PROMPT.md and STATUS.md created |
| 2026-03-30 | Preflight complete | Traced ParsedTask, AllocatedLane, PersistedTaskRecord, LaneTaskOutcome, resolveCanonicalTaskPaths. TMUX naming in AllocatedLane.tmuxSessionName, PersistedLaneRecord.tmuxSessionName, LaneStatus.tmuxSession. Packet paths partially lifted in v4/TP-081 fields but not yet authoritative. |
| 2026-03-30 | Steps 0-1 complete | Added all Runtime V2 contracts to types.ts + 43 tests |
| 2026-03-30 | Steps 2-3 complete | Added bridge helpers to execution.ts + 12 bridge tests. Full suite: 3185 pass, 0 fail |
| 2026-03-30 | Step 4 complete | No doc divergence. Task complete. |
