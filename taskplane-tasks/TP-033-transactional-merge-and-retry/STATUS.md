### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Read merge flow end-to-end
- [ ] Read v3 state retry fields
- [ ] Read roadmap Phase 4 sections
- [ ] R002: Fix Reviews table structure (separator after header) and normalize Execution Log timestamps

---

### Step 1: Transaction Envelope
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Define TransactionRecord interface in types.ts with required fields: opId, batchId, waveIndex, laneNumber, repoId, baseHEAD, laneHEAD, mergedHEAD, status, rollbackAttempted, rollbackResult, recoveryCommands, timestamps
- [ ] Capture baseHEAD (temp branch HEAD before lane merge) and laneHEAD (source branch tip) at merge start; capture mergedHEAD after successful merge commit
- [ ] On verification_new_failure: rollback to baseHEAD (existing TP-032 logic); record rollback result in transaction record
- [ ] On rollback failure: implement safe-stop — set MergeWaveResult flag `rollbackFailed`, emit recovery commands in transaction record, signal engine to force `paused` regardless of on_merge_failure policy, preserve merge worktree and temp branch (skip cleanup)
- [ ] Engine integration: detect rollbackFailed flag in MergeWaveResult and force paused phase + preserveWorktreesForResume regardless of config policy
- [ ] Persist transaction record JSON to `.pi/verification/{opId}/txn-b{batchId}-repo-{repoId}-wave-{n}-lane-{k}.json` after each lane merge completes (success, failure, or safe-stop)
- [ ] Handle repo-mode (repoId undefined): sanitize filename to use "default" when repoId is absent
- [ ] R004-1: Short-circuit mergeWaveByRepo repo-group loop on rollbackFailed — stop processing subsequent repo groups when anyRollbackFailed becomes true; leave unprocessed repo groups untouched
- [ ] R004-2: Surface transaction record persistence failure in merge outcome — add persistenceErrors to MergeWaveResult and include warning when txn write fails so recovery guidance remains actionable
- [ ] R004-3: All tests pass after R004 revisions

---

### Step 2: Retry Policy Matrix
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Define MergeFailureClassification type and per-class retry policy matrix (verification_new_failure: max 1/0s, merge_conflict_unresolved: no retry, cleanup_post_merge_failed: max 1/2s + wave gate, git_worktree_dirty: max 1/2s, git_lock_file: max 2/3s) as a centralized pure lookup in types.ts
- [ ] Implement classifyMergeFailure helper to map MergeWaveResult + lane errors to MergeFailureClassification
- [ ] Update retryCountByScope key format to `{repoId}:w{N}:l{K}` with "default" fallback for repo mode; add migration/compat note in JSDoc
- [ ] Implement computeMergeRetryDecision pure helper in messages.ts: given classification + current retry count + policy matrix → returns retry-allowed, cooldown, or exhaustion-pause action
- [ ] Integrate retry decision into engine.ts merge failure handling: before applying pause/abort policy, check retry matrix; if retriable and under max, sleep cooldown then re-invoke mergeWaveByRepo; persist incremented retry counter to batch state
- [ ] Mirror retry integration in resume.ts for execution/resume parity
- [ ] Ensure cleanup_post_merge_failed remains a hard wave gate (no advancement to next wave) — existing computeCleanupGatePolicy already handles this; verify no bypass
- [ ] On retry exhaustion: enter paused with diagnostic message including classification, attempt count, and scope key
- [ ] R006-1: Extract shared `applyMergeRetryLoop` helper used by both engine.ts and resume.ts; wrap retry in a loop that re-classifies after each failed attempt, supports maxAttempts>1 (e.g. git_lock_file), and returns structured outcome
- [ ] R006-2: On retry exhaustion, force `paused` phase regardless of `on_merge_failure` config (do not route through computeMergeFailurePolicy); emit matrix-specific diagnostics
- [ ] R006-3: Improve repo-scoped key extraction for setup failures (failedLane===null) by falling back to repoResults metadata
- [ ] R006-4: All tests pass after R006 revisions

---

### Step 3: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Transaction record tests: successful merge captures pre/post refs (baseHEAD, laneHEAD, mergedHEAD) in record
- [ ] Rollback tests: verification failure triggers rollback to baseHEAD
- [ ] Safe-stop tests: rollback failure enters safe-stop with preserved state, recovery commands emitted, engine/resume force paused
- [ ] Non-retriable class test: merge_conflict_unresolved immediately enters paused with no retry
- [ ] Multi-attempt retry test: git_lock_file retries up to maxAttempts=2, then exhaustion-pauses
- [ ] Cooldown delay test: retry enforces cooldown delay (non-zero) between attempts
- [ ] Retry counter persistence tests: counters persist and increment in batch state scoped by repoId:w{N}:l{K}
- [ ] Exhaustion tests: max attempts exhaustion forces paused regardless of on_merge_failure config
- [ ] Engine/resume parity test: same failure classification leads to same phase transition and counter updates in both engine.ts and resume.ts code paths
- [ ] Transaction persistence warning test: persistence failure surfaces in merge outcome with recovery guidance
- [ ] Workspace-scoped counter tests: retry counters scoped by repoId in workspace mode
- [ ] Full test suite passes (all existing + new tests)

---

### Step 4: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Document merge retry policy in task-orchestrator.yaml.md: failure classifications table, retriable vs non-retriable behavior, max attempts/cooldowns, exhaustion behavior, scope key format, and precedence with on_merge_failure
- [ ] Assess commands.md impact — no update needed: TP-033 changes are internal to the merge flow (MergeWaveResult fields, retry logic, transaction records). No new commands, changed flags, or user-facing command output format changes. The retry/safe-stop behavior surfaces through existing pause/status mechanisms.
- [ ] Completion gate: docs reflect implemented behavior, impact check done, STATUS/review entries current → `.DONE` created
- [ ] R010-1: Fix non-retriable failure behavior description — non-retriable classes fall through to standard `on_merge_failure` policy (pause or abort), NOT forced pause. Update "Retry behavior" step 5 and `merge_conflict_unresolved` exhaustion action column. Add explicit note: forced pause overrides config only on retry exhaustion and rollback safe-stop.
- [ ] R010-2: Remove stale `.DONE` and re-create after fixes verified

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| TP-032 already captures `preLaneHead` and rolls back on `verification_new_failure` with `blockAdvancement` flag. TP-033 must formalize this into a transaction record with `laneHEAD` and `mergedHEAD`, add safe-stop semantics (force `paused` + preserve all state + emit recovery commands), and persist the transaction record JSON. | Inform Step 1 design | `extensions/taskplane/merge.ts:420-480` |
| `ResilienceState.retryCountByScope` already exists in v3 types, keyed by `{taskId}:w{waveIndex}:l{laneNumber}`. PROMPT specifies `{repoId}:w{N}:l{K}` scoping. Must align scope key format with the roadmap's `(repoId, wave, lane)` tuple. | Inform Step 2 design | `extensions/taskplane/types.ts` |
| Retry policy matrix from roadmap §4c defines 15 failure classes. Only merge-related classes are in scope for TP-033: `verification_new_failure`, `merge_conflict_unresolved`, `cleanup_post_merge_failed`, `git_worktree_dirty`, `git_lock_file`. Task-level classes (api_error, context_overflow, etc.) are Phase 1/3 concerns. | Scope clarification | Roadmap §4c |
