### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Read `ensureTaskFilesCommitted` — understand staging commit flow
- [x] Read `executeWave` — confirm sequencing (staging before worktree creation)
- [x] Read orch branch creation in `engine.ts` — confirm it runs before `executeWave`
- [x] Confirm `baseBranch` param in `executeWave` is the orch branch name
- [x] Verify test baseline

### Step 1: Fast-forward orch branch after staging commit
**Status:** 🟨 In Progress
