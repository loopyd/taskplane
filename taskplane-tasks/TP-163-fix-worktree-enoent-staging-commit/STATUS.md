### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Read `ensureTaskFilesCommitted` — understand staging commit flow
- [x] Read `executeWave` — confirm sequencing (staging before worktree creation)
- [x] Read orch branch creation in `engine.ts` — confirm it runs before `executeWave`
- [x] Confirm `baseBranch` param in `executeWave` is the orch branch name
- [x] Verify test baseline

---

### Step 1: Fast-forward orch branch after staging commit
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Add `orchBranch?: string` param to `ensureTaskFilesCommitted`
- [x] After staging commit: get orchBranch tip SHA + HEAD SHA
- [x] Check ancestry: if `merge-base --is-ancestor <orchTip> <newHead>` → FF case: `update-ref` with expected-old-sha
- [x] Non-FF case (orchBranch advanced with wave merges): use `git merge-tree --write-tree <orchTip> <newHead>` to compute merged tree, then `commit-tree` to create merge commit, then `update-ref` with expected-old-sha
- [x] Wrap entire ref-update in try/catch — non-fatal on failure (log warning)
- [x] Pass `orchBranch` (= `baseBranch`) from `executeWave` to `ensureTaskFilesCommitted`
- [x] Verify workspace mode correctness

---

### Step 2: Testing & Verification
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Full test suite passing
- [x] CLI smoke passing
- [x] Fix all failures
