### Step 0: Preflight and Root Cause Analysis
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Read resume.ts — task allocation reconstruction from persisted state
- [ ] Read engine.ts — how expanded segments are persisted
- [ ] Read execution.ts — orch branch creation per-repo in workspace mode
- [ ] Trace `allocTask.task.taskFolder undefined` crash
- [ ] Trace workspace orch branch gaps
- [ ] Document findings

---

### Step 1: Fix Segment Expansion Resume Crash
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Fix `reconstructAllocatedLanes` to always set `taskFolder` on task stubs (resume.ts)
- [ ] Add guard in `buildExecutionUnit` for missing/empty `taskFolder` (execution.ts)
- [ ] Add guard in `buildMergeRequest` and merge sort for null `task` stubs (merge.ts)
- [ ] Add guard in abort.ts for null task stubs
- [ ] Run targeted tests: resume*.test.ts (37 pass, 0 fail)

---

### Step 2: Fix Workspace Orch Branch Coverage
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Refactor `ensureTaskFilesCommitted` to commit on orch branch, not base branch (execution.ts)
- [ ] Add `runGitWithEnv` helper to git.ts for plumbing-based orch branch commits
- [ ] Add orch branch existence verification in resume path (resume.ts)
- [ ] Run targeted tests: workspace*.test.ts (94 pass), engine*.test.ts (78 pass)

---

### Step 3: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] FULL test suite passing (3290 tests, 0 failures)
- [ ] Regression test: resume after segment expansion (3 tests in resume-segment-frontier.test.ts)
- [ ] Regression test: workspace all repos have orch branch (3 tests in engine-segment-frontier.test.ts)
- [ ] All failures fixed (zero failures in full suite)

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Bug #1 root cause: `reconstructAllocatedLanes` in resume.ts creates task stubs without `taskFolder` when `persistedTask.taskFolder` is empty string (falsy check). The stub has other fields (segmentIds, etc.) so it's not null, but `taskFolder` is `undefined`. Crash when `buildExecutionUnit` (execution.ts:2097) or merge code accesses `task.task.taskFolder`. | Fix in Step 1 | resume.ts:161, execution.ts:2097, merge.ts:1945 |
| Bug #2 root cause: `ensureTaskFilesCommitted` (execution.ts:1399) commits task files on the primary repo's current branch (e.g. main), not the orch branch. The orch branch is updated via ff/merge afterward, but the base branch is also modified, breaking isolation. | Fix in Step 2 | execution.ts:1399-1580 |
| Bug #2 additional: In resume path, orch branch is not re-verified in all workspace repos before wave execution. If orch branch was deleted/corrupted, `resolveBaseBranch` silently falls back to repo's current branch. | Fix in Step 2 | resume.ts, waves.ts:564 |
