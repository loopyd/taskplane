### Step 0: Preflight and Root Cause Analysis
**Status:** ✅ Done

- [x] Read resume.ts — task allocation reconstruction from persisted state
- [x] Read engine.ts — how expanded segments are persisted
- [x] Read execution.ts — orch branch creation per-repo in workspace mode
- [x] Trace `allocTask.task.taskFolder undefined` crash
- [x] Trace workspace orch branch gaps
- [x] Document findings

### Step 1: Fix Segment Expansion Resume Crash
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

> ⚠️ Hydrate: Expand based on root cause analysis in Step 0

- [ ] Populate taskFolder for dynamically-added segments
- [ ] Ensure PersistedSegmentRecord fields complete
- [ ] Run targeted tests

---

### Step 2: Fix Workspace Orch Branch Coverage
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

> ⚠️ Hydrate: Expand based on analysis in Step 0

- [ ] Ensure all repos get orch branch before execution
- [ ] Verify worktree creation uses orch branch
- [ ] Run targeted tests

---

### Step 3: Testing & Verification
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] FULL test suite passing
- [ ] Regression test: resume after segment expansion
- [ ] Regression test: workspace all repos have orch branch
- [ ] All failures fixed

### Step 4: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] Discoveries logged

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Bug #1 root cause: `reconstructAllocatedLanes` in resume.ts creates task stubs without `taskFolder` when `persistedTask.taskFolder` is empty string (falsy check). The stub has other fields (segmentIds, etc.) so it's not null, but `taskFolder` is `undefined`. Crash when `buildExecutionUnit` (execution.ts:2097) or merge code accesses `task.task.taskFolder`. | Fix in Step 1 | resume.ts:161, execution.ts:2097, merge.ts:1945 |
| Bug #2 root cause: `ensureTaskFilesCommitted` (execution.ts:1399) commits task files on the primary repo's current branch (e.g. main), not the orch branch. The orch branch is updated via ff/merge afterward, but the base branch is also modified, breaking isolation. | Fix in Step 2 | execution.ts:1399-1580 |
| Bug #2 additional: In resume path, orch branch is not re-verified in all workspace repos before wave execution. If orch branch was deleted/corrupted, `resolveBaseBranch` silently falls back to repo's current branch. | Fix in Step 2 | resume.ts, waves.ts:564 |
