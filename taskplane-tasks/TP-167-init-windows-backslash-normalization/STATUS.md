### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Read bin/taskplane.mjs init path-writing code
- [ ] Identify all unguarded path writes
- [ ] Check for existing normalize utility

---

### Step 1: Normalize Paths to Forward Slashes
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Normalize paths in workspace YAML writes
- [ ] Normalize paths in taskplane-config.json writes
- [ ] Cover all init presets and modes
- [ ] Run targeted tests

---

### Step 2: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] FULL test suite passing (3196/3196 pass)
- [ ] Add regression test: backslash paths normalized
- [ ] All failures fixed (none found)

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Original fix (544904d2) already added caller-side normalization in `getPresetVars`, `getInteractiveVars`, and workspace reinit. This task adds defense-in-depth normalization at the output functions (`generateProjectConfig`, `generateWorkspaceYaml`, `workspace.json` write). | Implemented | `bin/taskplane.mjs` |
| No shared path normalization utility existed. Added `fwdSlash()` helper in `bin/taskplane.mjs`. | Implemented | `bin/taskplane.mjs` line 790 |
| `docs/tutorials/install.md` does not need Windows-specific path caveats — the normalization is fully transparent to users. | No action needed | — |
