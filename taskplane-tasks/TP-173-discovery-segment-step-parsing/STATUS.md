---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Read discovery.ts PROMPT.md parser
- [ ] Read types.ts ParsedTask interface
- [ ] Read spec sections A.1 and A.10
- [ ] Document findings

---

### Step 1: Add Types
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Add SegmentCheckboxGroup interface
- [ ] Add StepSegmentMapping interface
- [ ] Add stepSegmentMap to ParsedTask
- [ ] Run targeted tests

---

### Step 2: Implement Segment Parsing
**Status:** Pending

> ⚠️ Hydrated (R003 revision): Parser adds segment parsing into parsePromptForOrchestrator after step extraction.

- [ ] Add parseStepSegmentMapping helper function that extracts steps and their segment groups from PROMPT content, including fallback grouping: checkboxes before any `#### Segment:` marker (or in steps with no markers) map to the task's primary repoId (packetRepo fallback)
- [ ] Integrate helper into parsePromptForOrchestrator to populate stepSegmentMap on ParsedTask and return diagnostics alongside the mapping
- [ ] Handle edge cases: empty segments (non-fatal warning), duplicate repoId in step (discovery error), unknown repoId (non-fatal warning with suggested matches from workspace repos)
- [ ] Run targeted tests (discovery-routing tests + verify new parser path)
- [ ] R005-1: Fix fallback repo — use SEGMENT_FALLBACK_REPO_PLACEHOLDER sentinel replaced during routing resolution
- [ ] R005-2: Add unknown step-segment repoId validation against workspace repos in resolveTaskRouting, emitting SEGMENT_STEP_REPO_INVALID warnings
- [ ] R006-1: Fix duplicate repo detection for pre-segment fallback group + post-placeholder resolution
- [ ] R006-2: Resolve SEGMENT_FALLBACK_REPO_PLACEHOLDER in repo mode (not just workspace mode)
- [ ] R006-3: Add best-effort suggested matches to unknown-repo warnings

---

### Step 3: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] FULL test suite passing (3303/3303)
- [ ] Tests for segment markers, fallback, mixed, errors (14 tests in discovery-segment-steps.test.ts)
- [ ] All failures fixed (3317/3317 pass)

---

### Step 4: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Discoveries logged

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| parsePromptForOrchestrator() extracts ID, review, size, deps, file scope, exec target, segment DAG. Does NOT parse step sections/checkboxes. | Expected — new parsing needed | discovery.ts:356-576 |
| ParsedTask already has explicitSegmentDag, packetRepoId, segmentIds, activeSegmentId fields. stepSegmentMap is new. | Add as optional field | types.ts:91-131 |
| Spec A.1 defines SegmentCheckboxGroup {repoId, checkboxes[]} and StepSegmentMapping {stepNumber, stepName, segments[]} | Implement as specified | segment-aware-steps.md A.1 |
| SEGMENT_FALLBACK_REPO_PLACEHOLDER needed for deferred repo resolution. Parse-time repo may not be known. | Implemented as `__primary__` sentinel, resolved in routing (workspace) or runDiscovery (repo mode) | discovery.ts |
| Post-`## Steps` content (e.g., Completion Criteria) must be excluded from step parsing. Boundary detection using `## [^#]` regex. | Fixed during review cycle R009 | discovery.ts:418-424 |
| New error codes: SEGMENT_STEP_DUPLICATE_REPO (fatal), SEGMENT_STEP_EMPTY (warning), SEGMENT_STEP_REPO_INVALID (warning) | Added to types.ts DiscoveryError union | types.ts:591-595 |
