**Review Level:** 1
**Review Counter:** 0
**Iteration:** 3
**Size:** S

---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Read PROMPT.md and STATUS.md
- [ ] Read spec section 8
- [ ] Verify workspace clean state
- [ ] Verify TP-142 and TP-143 complete
- [ ] Establish regression baseline

### Step 1: Regression verification
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Reset workspace
- [ ] Run 6 existing tasks
- [ ] All pass unchanged
- [ ] Document baseline

### Step 2: Expansion test task
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Create expansion test task
- [ ] Verify TP-007 PROMPT explicitly instructs: api change → discover web dependency → call `request_segment_expansion` → finish api segment
- [ ] Verify TP-007 starts with only `api-service` segment before runtime expansion
- [ ] Worker expands to new repo
- [ ] Add unit coverage that `request_segment_expansion` writes the expected outbox request payload for TP-007-style api→web expansion
- [ ] Add unit coverage that expansion DAG mutation enforces `api-service` predecessor and schedules `web-client` continuation segment execution order
- [ ] Add unit coverage that approved expansion upserts/persists pending segment records for the inserted web segment
- [ ] Run targeted expansion unit tests and capture passing evidence for Step 2

### Step 3: Repeat-repo expansion test
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Formalize steering-based scope amendment in PROMPT.md (defer live TP-008 polyrepo e2e due merge-agent issue #439 and align Step 3 acceptance wording)
- [ ] Add unit coverage for repeat-repo expansion that creates `shared-libs::2` after `api-service` second-pass request
- [ ] Add unit coverage for repeat-repo dependency wiring so second-pass segment depends on `api-service` and rewires downstream dependents
- [ ] Add unit coverage for repeat-repo persistence metadata using orch-branch provisioning for the `::2` segment
- [ ] Run targeted repeat-repo expansion unit tests and capture passing evidence

### Step 4: Resume after expansion
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Add unit coverage for persisted state where expansion is approved before expanded segment execution
- [ ] Add unit coverage that resume reconstruction reactivates expanded segment execution frontier
- [ ] Add unit coverage that processed expansion request IDs prevent duplicate processing on resume
- [ ] Run targeted resume + expansion unit tests and capture passing evidence

### Step 5: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Expansion-focused unit tests pass (tool + engine + frontier coverage)
- [ ] Regression validation captured via unit test pass/fail status (live `/orch` TP-001..TP-006 deferred for issue #439)
- [ ] Resume-after-expansion unit coverage passes
- [ ] Full unit suite passing

### Step 6: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Document results
- [ ] Update spec if needed
- [ ] Update STATUS.md

## Notes

- R002 suggestion retained for traceability; Step 2 evidence is captured via targeted expansion unit test run output.
- Live polyrepo execution for TP-144 was deferred in this session due known merge-agent thinking hang issue (#439), per supervisor steering.

## Results Summary

- Added TP-007-style expansion tool coverage for outbox payload generation (`api-service` → `web-client`, `after-current`).
- Added expansion DAG + persistence coverage for inserted segment ordering and pending-segment upsert metadata.
- Added TP-008-style repeat-repo coverage for `shared-libs::2`, dependency rewiring, and orch-branch persistence metadata.
- Added resume coverage for approved-but-unexecuted expansion segments and resume-time duplicate-request suppression.
- Validation runs:
  - Targeted expansion tests: 39/39 passing
  - Polyrepo regression unit suite: 48/48 passing
  - Full unit suite: 3231/3231 passing

## Spec Impact

- No behavioral divergence from dynamic segment expansion design was found.
- No spec update required; only execution strategy changed (live e2e deferred in-session per issue #439 steering override).
