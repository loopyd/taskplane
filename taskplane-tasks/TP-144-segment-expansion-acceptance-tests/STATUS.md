# TP-144: Segment Expansion Acceptance Tests — Status

**Current Step:** Step 3: Repeat-repo expansion test
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-06
**Review Level:** 1
**Review Counter:** 5
**Iteration:** 3
**Size:** S

---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Read PROMPT.md and STATUS.md
- [x] Read spec section 8
- [x] Verify workspace clean state
- [x] Verify TP-142 and TP-143 complete
- [x] Establish regression baseline

### Step 1: Regression verification
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Reset workspace
- [x] Run 6 existing tasks
- [x] All pass unchanged
- [x] Document baseline

### Step 2: Expansion test task
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Create expansion test task
- [x] Verify TP-007 PROMPT explicitly instructs: api change → discover web dependency → call `request_segment_expansion` → finish api segment
- [x] Verify TP-007 starts with only `api-service` segment before runtime expansion
- [x] Worker expands to new repo
- [x] Add unit coverage that `request_segment_expansion` writes the expected outbox request payload for TP-007-style api→web expansion
- [x] Add unit coverage that expansion DAG mutation enforces `api-service` predecessor and schedules `web-client` continuation segment execution order
- [x] Add unit coverage that approved expansion upserts/persists pending segment records for the inserted web segment
- [x] Run targeted expansion unit tests and capture passing evidence for Step 2

### Step 3: Repeat-repo expansion test
**Status:** 🟨 In Progress
- [ ] Add unit coverage for repeat-repo expansion that creates `shared-libs::2` after `api-service` second-pass request
- [ ] Add unit coverage for repeat-repo dependency wiring so second-pass segment depends on `api-service` and rewires downstream dependents
- [ ] Add unit coverage for repeat-repo persistence metadata using orch-branch provisioning for the `::2` segment
- [ ] Run targeted repeat-repo expansion unit tests and capture passing evidence

### Step 4: Resume after expansion
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] Interrupt after expansion approved
- [ ] Resume
- [ ] Expanded segment executes
- [ ] No duplicate processing

### Step 5: Testing & Verification
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] All expansion tests pass
- [ ] All 6 regression tests pass
- [ ] Resume works
- [ ] Full unit suite passing

### Step 6: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] Document results
- [ ] Update spec if needed
- [ ] Update STATUS.md

## Execution Log

| Timestamp | Action | Outcome |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| 2026-04-05 | Task staged | PROMPT.md and STATUS.md created |
| 2026-04-06 04:56 | Task started | Runtime V2 lane-runner execution |
| 2026-04-06 04:56 | Step 0 started | Preflight |

| 2026-04-06 06:56 | Worker iter 1 | killed (wall-clock timeout) in 7200s, tools: 57 |
| 2026-04-06 07:31 | Regression rerun (`/orch all`) | Batch `20260406T033023`: TP-001..TP-003 succeeded; merge-agent timeout stalled wave 1 merge in api-service |
| 2026-04-06 07:40 | Baseline evidence documented | Confirmed full 6/6 pass + clean completion from `henrylach-20260404T202353` diagnostics/summary (no regressions in task behavior) |
| 2026-04-06 08:35 | Review R002 | plan Step 2: REVISE |

| 2026-04-06 08:56 | Agent escalate | Blocked on TP-144 Step 2 execution during live polyrepo execution path |
| 2026-04-06 08:56 | Worker iter 2 | killed (wall-clock timeout) in 7200s, tools: 133 |
| 2026-04-06 09:00 | Steering received | Pivoted remaining acceptance validation to unit-test coverage; defer live polyrepo execution due merge-agent thinking issue (#439) |
| 2026-04-06 09:02 | Review R005 | plan Step 2: REVISE (requested live e2e evidence; superseded by steering override to unit approach) |
| 2026-04-06 09:08 | Step 2 targeted tests | `tests/segment-expansion-tool.test.ts` + `tests/engine-segment-frontier.test.ts` passed (29/29) |

## Notes

- R002 suggestion retained for traceability; Step 2 evidence is captured via targeted expansion unit test run output.
- Live polyrepo execution for TP-144 was deferred in this session due known merge-agent thinking hang issue (#439), per supervisor steering.
