# TP-079: Workspace Packet-Home Contract and Mode Enforcement — Status

**Current Step:** None
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-28
**Review Level:** 2
**Review Counter:** 0
**Iteration:** 4
**Size:** M

---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Read current workspace config validation and mode-detection flow
- [ ] Confirm existing behavior for non-git cwd + missing workspace config
- [ ] Identify all call-sites that rely on `routing.tasksRoot` and `routing.defaultRepo`

---

### Step 1: Add packet-home routing contract
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress

- [ ] Add `workspace.routing.taskPacketRepo` to canonical schema/types
  - [ ] Update `extensions/taskplane/types.ts` (`WorkspaceRoutingConfig`, error-code union/docs)
  - [ ] Update `extensions/taskplane/workspace.ts` routing parse/build types
- [ ] Validate `taskPacketRepo` references an existing repo ID
  - [ ] Add deterministic validation branch in `loadWorkspaceConfig()`
  - [ ] Emit actionable `WorkspaceConfigError` with available repo IDs
- [ ] Enforce invariant: `routing.tasksRoot` resolves inside `repos[taskPacketRepo].path`
  - [ ] Reuse canonicalized path containment checks for cross-platform correctness
  - [ ] Add explicit error code/message for packet-home containment failure
- [ ] Enforce invariant: every configured task-area path resolves inside `tasksRoot`
  - [ ] Implement cross-config validation in `buildExecutionContext()` (after task-runner config load)
  - [ ] Keep workspace-YAML-only validation separate from task-runner-aware validation
- [ ] Provide actionable validation errors for invariant violations
  - [ ] Add stable error messages with offending path, expected root, and remediation hint

**Implementation note:** use existing `extensions/taskplane/workspace.ts` (no new `workspace-config.ts` split in this task).
**Compatibility policy:** if `routing.task_packet_repo` is missing in legacy workspace YAML, deterministically default to `routing.default_repo` and emit a compatibility warning.

---

### Step 2: Enforce deterministic mode selection
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress

- [ ] Ensure workspace config presence always forces workspace mode (no repo-mode fallback)
  - [ ] Keep workspace-config parse failures fatal in `buildExecutionContext()`
  - [ ] Ensure no downstream fallback path silently builds repo-mode context
- [ ] Ensure non-git cwd + no workspace config is a hard setup error with clear guidance
  - [ ] Add explicit startup validation in repo-mode branch of `buildExecutionContext()`
  - [ ] Emit actionable setup guidance (run from git repo or add workspace config)
- [ ] Verify startup errors are surfaced consistently through extension command guard paths
  - [ ] Store startup error message once during `session_start`
  - [ ] Reuse shared startup error message in `requireExecCtx()` and tool helper guards

---

### Step 3: Config loading + compatibility
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] Thread new field through JSON loader defaults and legacy YAML mapping
- [ ] Preserve backward compatibility messaging for older workspace configs (missing field)
- [ ] Add migration-safe defaults only where deterministic behavior remains valid

---

### Step 4: Testing & Verification
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] Add/adjust unit tests for `taskPacketRepo` validation and path invariants
- [ ] Add/adjust tests for deterministic mode selection and hard-fail cases
- [ ] Run full suite: `cd extensions && npx vitest run`
- [ ] Fix all failures

---

### Step 5: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] Update spec/status notes if behavior or naming changed during implementation
- [ ] Log discoveries in STATUS.md
- [ ] Create `.DONE`
