**Current Step:** None
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-29
**Review Level:** 2
**Review Counter:** 0
**Iteration:** 4
**Size:** L

---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Read the agent-mailbox-steering spec (Architecture + Delivery sections)
- [ ] Read current rpc-wrapper handleEvent/message_end flow
- [ ] Read spawnAgentTmux() in task-runner.ts and spawnMergeAgent() in merge.ts
- [ ] Read existing supervisor tool registration pattern (orch_retry_task)

---

### Step 1: Mailbox message format and write utilities
**Status:** Pending

#### 1a. Message schema in `extensions/taskplane/types.ts`
- [ ] Define `MailboxMessageType` as string union: `"steer" | "query" | "abort" | "info" | "reply" | "escalate"`
- [ ] Define `MailboxMessage` interface with fields:
  - `id: string` — format: `{timestamp}-{5char-hex-nonce}` (e.g., `"1774744971303-a7f2c"`)
  - `batchId: string` — must match current batch ID
  - `from: string` — sender identifier (`"supervisor"` or session name)
  - `to: string` — target session name or `"_broadcast"`
  - `timestamp: number` — epoch ms from Date.now()
  - `type: MailboxMessageType`
  - `content: string` — the message body (max 4KB UTF-8 bytes)
  - `expectsReply?: boolean` — optional, default false
  - `replyTo?: string | null` — optional, reference to a previous message ID
- [ ] Define `MAILBOX_MAX_CONTENT_BYTES = 4096` constant
- [ ] Define `MAILBOX_DIR_NAME = "mailbox"` constant

#### 1b. Path helpers in new `extensions/taskplane/mailbox.ts`
- [ ] Create `extensions/taskplane/mailbox.ts` module
- [ ] `mailboxRoot(stateRoot: string, batchId: string): string` → `.pi/mailbox/{batchId}/`
- [ ] `sessionInboxDir(stateRoot: string, batchId: string, sessionName: string): string` → `.../{sessionName}/inbox/`
- [ ] `sessionAckDir(stateRoot: string, batchId: string, sessionName: string): string` → `.../{sessionName}/ack/`
- [ ] `broadcastInboxDir(stateRoot: string, batchId: string): string` → `.../_broadcast/inbox/`

#### 1c. `writeMailboxMessage(stateRoot, batchId, to, opts)` utility
- [ ] Input type `WriteMailboxMessageOpts`: `{ from: string; type: MailboxMessageType; content: string; expectsReply?: boolean; replyTo?: string | null }`
- [ ] Generated inside utility: `id` (timestamp+nonce), `batchId` (from arg), `to` (from arg), `timestamp` (Date.now())
- [ ] Defaults: `expectsReply` → `false`, `replyTo` → `null`
- [ ] Generate message ID: `{Date.now()}-{crypto.randomBytes(3).toString('hex').slice(0,5)}`
- [ ] Build full `MailboxMessage` object with all fields
- [ ] Validate content size: `Buffer.byteLength(content, 'utf8') <= MAILBOX_MAX_CONTENT_BYTES`, throw descriptive error if exceeded
- [ ] Ensure inbox directory exists: `mkdirSync({sessionInboxDir}, { recursive: true })`
- [ ] Atomic write: write to temp file `{id}.msg.json.tmp` (does NOT match `*.msg.json` glob) in **same directory** as inbox, then `renameSync()` to final `{id}.msg.json`
- [ ] On write/rename failure: attempt cleanup of temp file, then re-throw
- [ ] Return the written `MailboxMessage` object (including generated ID)

#### 1d. `readInbox(inboxDir, expectedBatchId)` utility
- [ ] `readdirSync(inboxDir)` — return empty array if dir doesn't exist (ENOENT)
- [ ] Filter: only files ending with `.msg.json` (excludes `.msg.json.tmp` temp files)
- [ ] Read each file, parse JSON, validate shape:
  - Required: `id` (string), `batchId` (string), `to` (string), `type` (string in MailboxMessageType set), `content` (string), `timestamp` (finite number), `from` (string)
  - Invalid shape → warn to stderr, skip, leave in inbox (no throw/crash)
- [ ] Reject messages where `batchId !== expectedBatchId` — log warning to stderr, skip (leave in inbox)
- [ ] Skip files with malformed JSON — log warning, skip (leave in inbox)
- [ ] Sort: primary by `timestamp` (numeric ascending), tie-break by filename lexical order
- [ ] Return `Array<{ filename: string; message: MailboxMessage }>`

#### 1e. `ackMessage(inboxDir, filename)` utility
- [ ] Derive ack directory structurally: `join(dirname(inboxDir), 'ack')` — NOT string replacement (cross-platform safe)
- [ ] Ensure ack directory exists: `mkdirSync(ackDir, { recursive: true })`
- [ ] Atomic move: `renameSync(join(inboxDir, filename), join(ackDir, filename))`
- [ ] Handle ENOENT race gracefully (another process already acked) — return false
- [ ] Return true on success

#### 1f. Error handling and module export
- [ ] Write failures throw with descriptive messages
- [ ] Read/ack failures are best-effort (log, don't crash)
- [ ] All file ops use sync variants (matching rpc-wrapper pattern)
- [ ] Module: `extensions/taskplane/mailbox.ts` — direct imports by consumers (Step 2/4), NOT re-exported via index.ts (keeps surface minimal)

---

### Step 2: rpc-wrapper mailbox check and steer injection
**Status:** Pending

#### 2a. CLI argument parsing
- [ ] Add `--mailbox-dir <path>` to `parseArgs()` in rpc-wrapper.mjs
- [ ] Store as `args.mailboxDir` (null when not provided)
- [ ] Update printUsage() help text

#### 2b. Steering mode at session startup
- [ ] After sending prompt command, if mailboxDir is set, send `{"type": "set_steering_mode", "mode": "all"}` to pi via proc.stdin
- [ ] Only when mailboxDir is provided (backward compatible)

#### 2c. Inbox check on message_end
- [ ] In handleEvent `message_end` case, after displayProgress and querySessionStats, call `checkMailboxAndSteer()`
- [ ] `checkMailboxAndSteer()`: readdirSync on `{mailboxDir}/inbox/` for `*.msg.json` files
- [ ] **Broadcast is deferred to TP-092 (Phase 4)** — do NOT consume `_broadcast/inbox` in this task
- [ ] Derive paths: `inboxDir = join(mailboxDir, 'inbox')`, `expectedSessionName = basename(mailboxDir)`, `expectedBatchId = basename(dirname(mailboxDir))`
- [ ] ENOENT on inbox readdirSync is quiet no-op (inbox dir may not exist yet)
- [ ] Read each `*.msg.json` file, parse JSON, validate:
  - `batchId` matches `expectedBatchId` (derived from path, not message content)
  - `to` matches `expectedSessionName` (no misdelivery)
  - `id` (string), `content` (string), `type` (string in MAILBOX_MESSAGE_TYPES set)
  - `timestamp` is finite number (required for deterministic sort)
  - Invalid messages: log warning, skip, leave in inbox
- [ ] **Sort messages by timestamp ascending, filename lexical as tie-break** before injection
- [ ] For each valid message: `proc.stdin.write(JSON.stringify({ type: 'steer', message: content }) + '\n')`
- [ ] Move delivered messages from inbox/ to ack/ via rename (create ack/ dir if needed, ENOENT non-fatal)
- [ ] Log to stderr: `[STEERING] Delivered message {id}`
- [ ] Skip silently when mailboxDir is null (backward compatible)
- [ ] Wrap in try/catch — never crash on mailbox I/O errors

#### 2d. Export for testing
- [ ] Export checkMailboxAndSteer and isValidMailboxMessageShape for unit testing

---

### Step 3: Thread mailbox-dir through spawn paths
**Status:** Pending

#### 3a. task-runner spawnAgentTmux() — auto-derive mailbox dir inside
- [ ] Inside spawnAgentTmux(): read `ORCH_BATCH_ID` from `process.env` (set by execution.ts)
- [ ] If present, derive mailbox dir: `join(getSidecarDir(), 'mailbox', batchId, sessionName)` — using sidecar dir (already `.pi/`), NOT stateRoot, to avoid `.pi/.pi/` double nesting
- [ ] Add `--mailbox-dir {quoteArg(mailboxDir)}` to wrapperArgs before `--`
- [ ] `mkdirSync(join(mailboxDir, 'inbox'), { recursive: true })` before spawn
- [ ] When `ORCH_BATCH_ID` is absent (standalone `/task` mode), skip mailbox entirely

#### 3b. merge.ts spawnMergeAgent() — accept batchId as explicit parameter
- [ ] Add `batchId` as explicit parameter (thread from existing caller context in mergeWaveByRepo)
- [ ] Construct mailbox dir: `join(sidecarRoot, 'mailbox', batchId, sessionName)`
- [ ] Pass `--mailbox-dir {shellQuote(mailboxDir)}` in wrapperParts
- [ ] `mkdirSync(join(mailboxDir, 'inbox'), { recursive: true })` before spawn

#### 3c. Update merge callers to pass batchId
- [ ] In merge.ts `mergeWave()`, pass batchId through to both spawnMergeAgent callsites

#### 3d. Fix ORCH_BATCH_ID propagation for retry/re-exec spawns
- [ ] In engine.ts Tier 0 retry callsite: add `ORCH_BATCH_ID: batchState.batchId` to executeLane extraEnvVars
- [ ] In engine.ts model-fallback retry callsite: merge `ORCH_BATCH_ID: batchState.batchId` with existing `TASKPLANE_MODEL_FALLBACK` env var

---

### Step 4: Supervisor send_agent_message tool
**Status:** Pending

#### 4a. Tool registration in extension.ts
- [ ] Register `send_agent_message` tool with pi.registerTool() (same pattern as orch_retry_task)
- [ ] Parameters: `to` (string, required), `content` (string, required), `type` (string, optional, default 'steer')
- [ ] Description: send a steering message to a running agent

#### 4b. Session resolution and validation
- [ ] Resolve stateRoot: `execCtx?.workspaceRoot ?? execCtx?.repoRoot ?? ctx.cwd` (same as doOrchRetryTask)
- [ ] Load batch state from `{stateRoot}/.pi/batch-state.json`
- [ ] Build valid session names with explicit derivation:
  - Worker: `${lane.tmuxSessionName}-worker`
  - Reviewer: `${lane.tmuxSessionName}-reviewer`
  - Merger: `${tmuxPrefix}-${opId}-merge-${lane.laneNumber}` (NOT lane-level sessions)
- [ ] Validate `to` is in the known agent session set (error if not found)

#### 4c. Write message
- [ ] Validate `type` against outbound allowlist: `steer | query | abort | info` (default: steer). Reject `reply`/`escalate`.
- [ ] Call `writeMailboxMessage(stateRoot, batchId, to, { from: 'supervisor', ... })` from mailbox.ts
- [ ] Return confirmation with message ID, target, type, and batchId

---

### Step 5: Batch cleanup for mailbox directory
**Status:** 🟨 In Progress

#### 5a. Post-integrate cleanup (Layer 1)
- [ ] In `cleanupPostIntegrate()`: delete `{stateRoot}/.pi/mailbox/{batchId}/` directory tree
- [ ] Use rmSync with recursive + force (non-fatal)
- [ ] Add mailbox dir count to cleanup result

#### 5b. Age-based preflight sweep (Layer 2)
- [ ] In `sweepStaleArtifacts()`: sweep `{stateRoot}/.pi/mailbox/` subdirectories
- [ ] Delete batch subdirs older than 7 days (by mtime of directory)
- [ ] Use rmSync recursive for stale batch mailbox dirs

---

### Step 6: Testing & Verification
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] Create mailbox.test.ts with behavioral tests
- [ ] Full test suite passing
- [ ] All failures fixed
