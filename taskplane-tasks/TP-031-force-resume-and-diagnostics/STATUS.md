### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Read resume eligibility logic
- [ ] Read /orch-resume command handler
- [ ] Read phase transition logic
- [ ] Read roadmap Phase 3 sections
- [ ] Read CONTEXT.md and verify TP-030 dependency contracts (resilience/diagnostics types, persistence serialization)
- [ ] Read messages.ts computeMergeFailurePolicy and identify merge failure phase transition insertion points
- [ ] Record preflight findings: insertion points, force-resume contract, and resume eligibility matrix in Notes
- [ ] R002 fix: Deduplicate Reviews table — keep one canonical row per review ID with correct verdict
- [ ] R002 fix: Deduplicate Execution Log — single chronological sequence, no duplicate events
- [ ] R002 fix: Make status header consistent with step completion state

---

### Step 1: Implement Force-Resume Policy
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Add `parseResumeArgs()` in extension.ts with --force flag parsing, unknown-flag rejection, and usage guidance
- [ ] Update `checkResumeEligibility()` in resume.ts to accept `force: boolean` — stopped/failed become eligible with force, completed always rejected
- [ ] Add pre-resume diagnostics function in resume.ts: worktree health, branch consistency, state coherence (repo-aware for workspace mode); block resume if diagnostics fail with operator-facing reason
- [ ] Wire up: extension.ts handler calls parseResumeArgs → passes force to resumeOrchBatch → checkResumeEligibility(state, force) → run diagnostics → set resilience.resumeForced → reset phase to paused → continue
- [ ] Update ORCH_MESSAGES for force-resume notifications (force started, diagnostics failed, etc.)

---

### Step 2: Default Merge Failure to Paused
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Change engine.ts end-of-batch finalization: `failedTasks > 0` → `"paused"` (not `"failed"`) when phase is `"executing"`/`"merging"`, add `preserveWorktreesForResume = true` so worktrees survive for resume
- [ ] Change resume.ts end-of-batch finalization (parity): same `failedTasks > 0` → `"paused"` transition with worktree preservation
- [ ] Reserve `"failed"` for future unrecoverable invariant violations — add code comments documenting this intent at both sites
- [ ] Verify downstream: `isTerminalPhase` checks, completion banners, state cleanup, auto-integration gates all handle new `"paused"` outcome correctly (no functional change needed if they already handle paused)
- [ ] Add expected final-phase matrix to STATUS.md Notes section
- [ ] R006 fix: Move `failedTasks > 0 → paused` + `preserveWorktreesForResume = true` determination BEFORE cleanup in engine.ts so worktrees are preserved when tasks fail
- [ ] R006 fix: Same ordering fix in resume.ts — compute preservation intent before section 11 cleanup

---

### Step 3: Diagnostic Reports
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Create `extensions/taskplane/diagnostic-reports.ts` with JSONL event log generator and human-readable markdown summary generator; resolve opId via `resolveOperatorId(orchConfig)`; create `.pi/diagnostics/` dir; write failures are non-fatal (log + don't crash)
- [ ] JSONL events: one JSON line per task from `state.tasks[]` enriched with `state.diagnostics.taskExits{}`; fallback to task record fields when taskExits entry missing; deterministic sort by taskId; fields: batchId, taskId, phase, mode, status, classification, cost, durationSec, retries, repoId, exitReason
- [ ] Human-readable summary: markdown with batch overview (batchId, phase, duration, total cost), per-task table, per-repo breakdown when `mode === "workspace"`; graceful fallback when diagnostic data is sparse/empty
- [ ] Wire emission into engine.ts and resume.ts after `persistRuntimeState("batch-terminal", ...)` — call report generator with orchConfig, batchState, allTaskOutcomes, stateRoot; engine/resume parity
- [ ] R008 fix: Refactor `assembleDiagnosticInput()` to build tasks from `wavePlan` + `lanes` + `allTaskOutcomes` (like `serializeBatchState`), including pending/blocked tasks and repo attribution fields (`repoId`, `resolvedRepoId`); update both engine.ts and resume.ts call sites to pass `wavePlan` and `lanes`
- [ ] R008 fix: Fix `emitDiagnosticReports` docstring — remove incorrect reference to `batchState.errors` (function has no access to batchState)

---

### Step 4: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Force-resume eligibility tests: phase×force matrix (paused/executing/merging normal, stopped/failed with --force, completed always rejected, idle/planning rejected), parseResumeArgs (empty, --force, --help, unknown flag, positional arg)
- [ ] Merge failure phase tests: failedTasks>0 yields "paused" not "failed"; completed when 0 failures; engine/resume parity on this behavior
- [ ] Diagnostic report tests: buildDiagnosticEvents deterministic ordering, taskExits fallback precedence, workspace per-repo breakdown, sparse/empty data graceful fallback, eventsToJsonl correct format, buildMarkdownReport covers batch overview + per-task table + workspace repo sections + empty events
- [ ] Diagnostic emission robustness: emitDiagnosticReports non-fatal on write failure (mock writeFileSync throw)
- [ ] Full test suite passes (`cd extensions && npx vitest run`) — 33/35 suites pass, 2 pre-existing failures (cleanup-resilience, worktree-lifecycle) are Windows `git init` temp dir issues unrelated to TP-031; all 59 TP-031 tests pass
- [ ] R010 fix: Add `expect(preCleanupIdx).toBeLessThan(cleanupIdx)` ordering assertion in resume.ts parity test
- [ ] R010 fix: Add force-resume runtime path tests — diagnostics failure blocks resume, diagnostics success allows forced resume, `resilience.resumeForced` persisted only on success
- [ ] R010 fix: Improve emission robustness tests — assert spy call counts for write-failure paths, add success-path emission test verifying both files written with expected filenames
- [ ] R010 fix: Deduplicate STATUS.md review rows and execution log entries
- [ ] Full test suite green after R010 fixes — 35/35 suites, 1399 tests pass

---

### Step 5: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** 🟨 In Progress
- [ ] Update `docs/reference/commands.md` — `/orch-resume [--force]` syntax, force-only phases, normal phases, completed rejection, example invocations
- [ ] Evaluate README.md command table — updated `/orch-resume` row to show `[--force]` flag and expanded description
- [ ] Final delivery: create `.DONE`, mark step complete in STATUS.md, log completion

## Notes

### Preflight Findings (Step 0)

**Insertion Points:**

1. **Force-resume gating:** `/orch-resume` handler in `extension.ts` (line ~549). Currently passes no `force` flag. Add `--force` parsing and pass boolean into `resumeOrchBatch()`.
2. **Resume eligibility override:** `checkResumeEligibility()` in `resume.ts` (line ~119). Add `force: boolean` parameter. When force=true, `stopped` and `failed` phases become eligible.
3. **Force intent recording:** In `resumeOrchBatch()` after eligibility check passes, set `batchState.resilience.resumeForced = true` before persisting.
4. **Diagnostic report emission:** In `engine.ts` at batch terminal (line ~993-1033) and in `resume.ts` at terminal (same pattern). After `persistRuntimeState("batch-terminal", ...)`, call new diagnostic report generator.
5. **Merge failure phase transition:** `computeMergeFailurePolicy()` in `messages.ts` already returns `targetPhase: "paused"` for `on_merge_failure: "pause"` (the default). The batch-end logic in `engine.ts` (line 993-999) sets `phase = "failed"` when `failedTasks > 0` — this is where merge-caused failures lead to terminal `failed` state.

**Resume Eligibility Matrix (Current vs Required):**

| Phase | Current | TP-031 Required |
|---|---|---|
| `paused` | ✅ eligible | ✅ eligible (normal) |
| `executing` | ✅ eligible | ✅ eligible (normal) |
| `merging` | ✅ eligible | ✅ eligible (normal) |
| `stopped` | ❌ rejected | ⚠️ `--force` only |
| `failed` | ❌ rejected | ⚠️ `--force` only |
| `completed` | ❌ rejected | ❌ rejected (always) |
| `idle` | ❌ rejected | ❌ rejected |
| `planning` | ❌ rejected | ❌ rejected |

**Force-resume contract:** `/orch-resume --force` → parse flag in extension.ts → pass `force: boolean` to `resumeOrchBatch()` → `checkResumeEligibility(state, force)` → if force && (stopped|failed), return eligible → run pre-resume diagnostics → set `resilience.resumeForced = true` → reset phase to `paused` → continue normal resume flow.

**TP-030 Dependency Status:** Verified. `ResilienceState` type exists with `resumeForced: boolean`. `BatchDiagnostics` type exists with `taskExits` and `batchCost`. `serializeBatchState()` serializes both with defaults. State validation in `loadBatchState()` validates v3 schema.

### Final-Phase Matrix (After Step 2 — TP-031)

| Scenario | Phase Before | Phase After | Resumable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| All tasks succeed, no errors | `executing` | `completed` | N/A (done) |
| Some tasks failed (execution failures) | `executing` | `paused` | ✅ normal resume |
| Merge failure + `on_merge_failure: pause` (default) | `executing` → merge | `paused` | ✅ normal resume |
| Merge failure + `on_merge_failure: abort` | `executing` → merge | `stopped` | ⚠️ `--force` only |
| Operator pause signal | `executing` | `paused` | ✅ normal resume |
| Cleanup gate failure | `executing` → cleanup | `stopped` | ⚠️ `--force` only |
| Unrecoverable invariant violation (future) | any | `failed` | ⚠️ `--force` only |
| All tasks complete successfully | `executing` | `completed` | ❌ rejected |
