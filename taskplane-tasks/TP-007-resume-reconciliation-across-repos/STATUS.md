### Step 0: Implement repo-aware reconciliation
**Status:** Pending

**Identity matching rules (deterministic key precedence):**
- v2 path: `persistedState.tasks[].resolvedRepoId` + `persistedState.lanes[].repoId` identify repo affinity.
  Lane→task matching uses `laneRecord.taskIds.includes(task.taskId)` (same as v1, repo is an attribute not a key).
  Session names are globally unique (`orch-lane-N`) so tmux session checks remain repo-agnostic.
- v1 path (repo fields absent): `mode="repo"` after upconvert, all fields `undefined`. Falls through to
  single-repo behavior identically to pre-polyrepo code — `resolveRepoRoot(undefined, repoRoot, null)` returns `repoRoot`.

**Signal resolution rules (.DONE and worktree existence):**
- `.DONE` check: `hasTaskDoneMarker(task.taskFolder)` — `taskFolder` is already an absolute path (set by discovery
  from `workspaceConfig.routing.tasksRoot` in workspace mode). Works across repos without `resolveRepoRoot`.
- Worktree existence: `existsSync(laneRecord.worktreePath)` — `worktreePath` is already absolute. Works across repos.
- Repo root needed for: worktree resets between waves, worktree cleanup at batch end, branch deletion after merge,
  re-execute task spawning, and reconnect polling. All must use `resolveRepoRoot(lane.repoId, repoRoot, workspaceConfig)`.

**Non-goals for Step 0:**
- No changes to `reconcileTaskStates()` or `computeResumePoint()` — these are pure functions operating on
  abstract signal sets (session name sets, task ID sets). Repo awareness lives in the caller that gathers signals.
- No changes to wave continuation logic (Step 1 scope).
- No cross-repo dependency graph changes.

- [ ] Fix `resumeOrchBatch` to use `resolveRepoRoot()` for per-lane repo roots in: reconnect polling, re-execute spawning, inter-wave worktree reset, and terminal worktree cleanup
  - FINDING: All four areas were already repo-aware (done in prior TP-005/TP-006 work). Added `collectRepoRoots` helper function for test/reuse.
- [ ] Ensure v1 state files (no repo fields) resume identically to pre-polyrepo behavior
  - Verified: `resolveRepoRoot(undefined, repoRoot, null)` returns `repoRoot` — v1 fallback works.
- [ ] Add tests for mixed-repo reconciliation scenarios:
  - Workspace v2 state: one repo lane alive + another dead → correct reconcile actions ✅
  - Workspace v2 state: `.DONE` in one repo + dead session in another → mark-complete vs mark-failed ✅
  - v1 state (no repo fields) reconciles correctly with all-undefined repo fields ✅
  - Worktree exists vs missing split across repos → correct re-execute vs mark-failed ✅
  - `resolveRepoRoot` integration: v2 lanes get correct repo root, v1/undefined lanes get default root ✅
  - `collectRepoRoots`: workspace mode collects per-repo roots, repo mode returns only default ✅
  - Cross-repo `computeResumePoint`: mixed outcomes, both alive, all completed ✅

### Step 1: Compute repo-aware resume point
**Status:** Pending

**Decision table — reconciled action → continuation outcome:**

| Reconciled action | Persisted status | Continuation outcome | Counter effect |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| mark-complete     | any             | `completedTaskIds` (succeeded) | `succeededTasks++` |
| skip (succeeded)  | succeeded       | `completedTaskIds` (succeeded) | (already counted) |
| skip (failed)     | failed/stalled  | `failedTaskIds` (terminal)     | (already counted) |
| skip (skipped)    | skipped         | treated as terminal for wave-skip; not re-queued | (already counted) |
| reconnect         | running/pending | wait for poll → succeeded or failed | `succeededTasks++` or `failedTasks++` |
| re-execute        | running/pending | re-spawn → succeeded or failed | `succeededTasks++` or `failedTasks++` |
| mark-failed       | running/pending | `failedTaskIds` (terminal) | `failedTasks++` |

**Blocked propagation rules (skip-dependents policy):**
- After reconciliation AND after reconnect/re-execute resolve, compute `computeTransitiveDependents(failedTaskSet, depGraph)`.
- Merge result with persisted `blockedTaskIds` (union, not replace) so repeated resume can't lose prior blocked tasks.
- Seed `batchState.blockedTaskIds` with the merged set BEFORE the wave loop begins.
- Within wave loop: `executeWave()` produces new blocked IDs from NEW wave failures (same as engine.ts).

**Counter invariants across resume boundaries:**
- `succeededTasks`: initialized from `resumePoint.completedTaskIds.length`, incremented by reconnect/re-execute successes and wave successes.
- `failedTasks`: initialized from `resumePoint.failedTaskIds.length`, incremented by reconnect/re-execute failures and wave failures.
- `skippedTasks`: carried from `persistedState.skippedTasks`, incremented only by wave execution.
- `blockedTasks`: carried from `persistedState.blockedTasks`, incremented per-wave for tasks in `blockedTaskIds` that appear in that wave (same as engine.ts).
- `blockedTaskIds`: union of `persistedState.blockedTaskIds` + newly computed transitive dependents from all reconciled+reconnect+re-execute failures.

**Skipped task semantics:**
- `computeResumePoint` wave-skip: `persistedStatus === "skipped"` treated as terminal (wave is "done" for skip purposes).
- `computeResumePoint` pending aggregation: skipped tasks with `persistedStatus === "skipped"` are NOT re-queued.
- Wave execution filtering: already excluded by `failedTaskSet`/`completedTaskSet`/`blockedTaskIds` + discovery filter.

- [ ] Seed `blockedTaskIds` from reconciled failures before wave loop (import + call `computeTransitiveDependents` in `resumeOrchBatch` after reconciliation/reconnect/re-execute phases)
  - Already present in source (section 9b). Verified and tested.
- [ ] Fix `computeResumePoint` to treat `persistedStatus === "skipped"` as terminal for wave-skip and NOT re-queue skipped tasks
  - Added `"skipped"` to wave-skip condition in `computeResumePoint` (was missing — pre-existing gap)
  - Added `"pending"` reconciliation action for never-started tasks (pending + no session) to prevent incorrect mark-failed
  - Fixed blocked task counter double-counting with `persistedBlockedTaskIds` tracking
  - Separated `mark-complete` from `skip` case in categorization switch for clarity
- [ ] Add tests: reconciled failure in repo A blocks dependent in repo B under `skip-dependents`; persisted skipped tasks not re-queued; blocked/skipped counter stability across pause/resume; v1 fallback parity
  - 8 new test cases: pending-vs-failed distinction, skipped wave-skip, all-failed wave, counter stability, cross-repo blocked propagation, v1 fallback, workspace resume semantics
  - All 290 tests passing across 12 test files

---

### Step 2: Execute resumed waves safely
**Status:** Pending

**Blocked counter contract across pause/resume:**
- `batchState.blockedTasks` is initialized from `persistedState.blockedTasks` (carried from prior run).
- `persistedBlockedTaskIds` tracks the set of IDs already counted in that carried value.
- Per-wave counting: count tasks in the wave that are in `blockedTaskIds` BUT NOT in `persistedBlockedTaskIds`.
- Problem: tasks newly blocked from reconciliation (section 9b) ARE added to `blockedTaskIds` but ARE NOT in `persistedBlockedTaskIds`. When their wave is reached, they ARE correctly counted (not excluded). ✅
- Problem: tasks blocked in a prior run but whose wave was never entered (prior pause happened before reaching that wave) — they ARE in `persistedBlockedTaskIds` so they ARE excluded from counting. But they were already counted in `persistedState.blockedTasks` since the prior run added them per-wave. So they should NOT be counted again. ✅
- Actual gap: if a task was persisted as blocked but its wave was never reached in the prior run, `persistedState.blockedTasks` would NOT have counted it (it's counted per-wave in engine.ts). But it IS in `persistedBlockedTaskIds`, so it's excluded from counting on resume. This means it's NEVER counted. Fix: on resume init, count persisted blocked IDs whose waves are >= resumeWaveIndex (they were blocked but their wave was never entered, so they were never counted).

**Metadata preservation strategy for resume checkpoints:**
- On resume, `latestAllocatedLanes` starts empty → first persist loses all lane records.
- Fix: reconstruct `AllocatedLane[]` from `persistedState.lanes` + discovery metadata at resume init.
- This preserves lane→task assignment, worktreePath, branch, repoId, and sessionName across resume checkpoints.
- For task repo attribution: `persistRuntimeState` already enriches from discovery. But tasks NOT in `discovery.pending` (completed/failed) lose repo fields. Fix: carry forward `repoId`/`resolvedRepoId` from persisted task records when not available from discovery or allocated lanes.

**Re-exec merge indexing:**
- Re-exec merge uses synthetic `waveIndex: 0` → `mergeWaveByRepo(..., 0, ...)`.
- Persistence normalizes: `waveIndex: mr.waveIndex - 1` → produces `-1`.
- Fix: use sentinel `waveIndex: -1` for re-exec merge (semantically "pre-wave-loop merge").
- Persistence: clamp with `Math.max(0, mr.waveIndex - 1)` to prevent negative indices.
- Dashboard: `-1` → displayed as "Re-executed" (or wave index 0 after clamping).

**Duplicated per-repo root collection:**
- Replace inline loops at inter-wave reset and terminal cleanup with `collectRepoRoots()` helper.
- Added `collectAllRepoRoots()` helper for merging repo roots from multiple sources (persisted + newly allocated lanes).
- Added `encounteredRepoRoots` tracking set: seeded from persisted lanes via `collectRepoRoots()`, augmented in `onLanesAllocated` callback.
- Inter-wave reset and terminal cleanup now use `encounteredRepoRoots` instead of only `persistedState.lanes`, covering repos introduced by resumed waves.

**Repo-root coverage contract (deterministic precedence):**
| Operation | Root source | Covers new repos? |
|---|---|---|
| Reconnect/re-execute | `resolveRepoRoot(laneRecord.repoId, ...)` | N/A (uses persisted lane) |
| Wave allocation | `executeWave(..., workspaceConfig)` → allocateLanes | Yes (internal) |
| Inter-wave reset | `encounteredRepoRoots` (persisted + wave-allocated) | ✅ Yes |
| Terminal cleanup | `encounteredRepoRoots` (persisted + wave-allocated) | ✅ Yes |

- [ ] Reconstruct `AllocatedLane[]` from persisted lanes + discovery at resume init to preserve lane/task metadata across checkpoints
- [ ] Carry forward task repo attribution (`repoId`, `resolvedRepoId`, `taskFolder`) from persisted task records for non-pending tasks
- [ ] Fix blocked counter: count persisted-blocked-but-never-wave-entered tasks at resume init
- [ ] Fix re-exec merge indexing: use sentinel value and clamp persistence normalization
- [ ] Replace duplicated per-repo root loops with `encounteredRepoRoots` tracking set + `collectAllRepoRoots()` helper
- [ ] Augment `encounteredRepoRoots` in `onLanesAllocated` callback to cover repos from new waves
- [ ] Add tests: checkpoint round-trip, blocked counter pause/resume, re-exec merge persistence, metadata preservation, collectAllRepoRoots, reconstructAllocatedLanes (740 total assertions, 0 failures)

## Discoveries
| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| resume.ts already had repo-aware patterns for all 4 critical areas (reconnect, re-execute, worktree reset, cleanup) from prior TP-005/TP-006 work | Verified + added test coverage | extensions/taskplane/resume.ts |
| engine.ts inter-wave worktree reset and terminal cleanup use single repoRoot (same gap as pre-fix resume.ts) — needs separate fix | Tech debt logged | extensions/taskplane/engine.ts:474,669 |
| `computeResumePoint` missing `"skipped"` in wave-skip terminal condition — pre-existing gap (waves with only skipped tasks would not be skipped over) | Fixed | extensions/taskplane/resume.ts:339 |
| `computeResumePoint` missing `"pending"` reconciliation action for never-started tasks (pending + no session) — all such tasks were incorrectly mark-failed | Fixed + added action type | extensions/taskplane/resume.ts:241, types.ts:1438 |
| Reconciled failures did not seed `blockedTaskIds` before wave loop (dependents of reconciled mark-failed tasks could execute under skip-dependents) | Fixed: added `computeTransitiveDependents` call in section 9b | extensions/taskplane/resume.ts:833 |
| `mark-failed` treated as terminal for wave-skip (semantic change: waves with all-failed tasks now skipped, reducing no-op loop iterations) | Intentional change + updated 15+ test expectations | extensions/taskplane/resume.ts:341 |
| Re-exec merge used `waveIndex: 0` → persistence normalization `waveIndex - 1` produced `-1` (invalid) | Fixed: sentinel `waveIndex: -1`, persistence clamps with `Math.max(0, ...)` | extensions/taskplane/resume.ts:825, persistence.ts:723 |
| Resume checkpoints lost lane/task repo attribution when `latestAllocatedLanes` was empty | Fixed: `reconstructAllocatedLanes(lanes, tasks)` carries repo fields from persisted task records | extensions/taskplane/resume.ts:74,915 |
| Blocked counter undercounted: persisted-blocked tasks in unvisited waves never counted | Fixed: count persisted-blocked IDs in waves >= resumeWaveIndex at resume init | extensions/taskplane/resume.ts:597 |
| Resume inter-wave/cleanup loops duplicated `collectRepoRoots()` logic inline | Fixed: replaced with `collectRepoRoots()` helper call | extensions/taskplane/resume.ts:920 |
| Inter-wave reset and terminal cleanup only used `persistedState.lanes` for repo root collection — repos introduced by resumed waves would be missed | Fixed: `encounteredRepoRoots` set seeded from persisted + augmented per wave | extensions/taskplane/resume.ts:1068,1281,1309 |
