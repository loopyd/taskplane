### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Read worktree cleanup logic
- [ ] Read task outcome recording
- [ ] Read roadmap Phase 2 section 2a
- [ ] Understand existing saved-branch logic
- [ ] R001: Read CONTEXT.md (Tier 2) and persistence.ts serialization contract
- [ ] R001: Read naming.ts and diagnostics.ts partialProgress fields for naming alignment
- [ ] R001: Identify all cleanup call sites and document insertion points for Steps 1-2
- [ ] R002: Fix Reviews table format and remove inconsistent duplicate entries
- [ ] R002: Fix top-level metadata to reflect actual state

---

### Step 1: Detect and Save Partial Progress
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Implement `savePartialProgress()` helper in worktree.ts: counts commits on lane branch vs target, creates saved branch with task-ID naming, handles collisions via resolveSavedBranchCollision, returns partial progress info
- [ ] Add `preserveFailedLaneProgress()` orchestration function in worktree.ts: iterates task outcomes, finds failed tasks with lane branches, calls savePartialProgress for each, returns set of preserved branch names
- [ ] Insert preservation call before inter-wave reset in engine.ts (R003 critical: prevents commit loss during between-wave resets)
- [ ] Insert preservation call before terminal cleanup in engine.ts removeAllWorktrees
- [ ] Insert preservation call before terminal cleanup in resume.ts removeAllWorktrees
- [ ] Pass preserved branch names to cleanup so ensureBranchDeleted skips them (R003: exemption mechanism) — Design decision: NOT NEEDED. savePartialProgress() creates a separate saved branch (saved/{opId}-{taskId}-{batchId}) at the lane branch SHA BEFORE cleanup. The lane branch can be safely deleted during cleanup since the saved branch preserves the commits independently. Existing ensureBranchDeleted may also create saved/task/... which is redundant but harmless.
- [ ] R004: Log explicit warnings for failed preservation attempts (per-task: taskId, laneBranch, repoId, error, commitCount) at all call sites in engine.ts and resume.ts
- [ ] R004: Handle failed-preservation-with-commits in inter-wave reset: skip worktree reset for lanes where preservation failed but commits existed (prevents commit loss)
- [ ] R004: Fix `preservedBranches` contract mismatch — update comments/interface to document that lane branches ARE still deleted (saved branch independently preserves commits), removing misleading "should NOT be deleted" language

---

### Step 2: Record Partial Progress in Task Outcome
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Add optional `partialProgressCommits` (number) and `partialProgressBranch` (string|null) to `LaneTaskOutcome` and `PersistedTaskRecord` in types.ts, with backward-compat defaults (0 / undefined)
- [ ] Update `upsertTaskOutcome()` change detection in persistence.ts to include the new fields
- [ ] Update all outcome construction sites (seedPendingOutcomesForAllocatedLanes, syncTaskOutcomesFromMonitor, resume.ts reconstitution) to carry/default the new fields
- [ ] Update `serializeBatchState()` in persistence.ts to map the new fields from `LaneTaskOutcome` → `PersistedTaskRecord`
- [ ] Add validation for the new optional fields in the state-file validation block in persistence.ts (backward-compatible: allow undefined)
- [ ] Populate fields at all 4 `preserveFailedLaneProgress()` call sites: engine.ts inter-wave, engine.ts terminal, resume.ts inter-wave, resume.ts terminal — update task outcomes with ppResult data after preservation
- [ ] R006: Fix nullability contract mismatch — normalize `partialProgressBranch` to `string | undefined` across LaneTaskOutcome, PersistedTaskRecord, serialization, and validation (currently typed as `string | null` in LaneTaskOutcome but validation rejects null)
- [ ] R006: Ensure serialization skips writing `partialProgressBranch` when undefined, and validate round-trip correctness at all boundaries

---

### Step 3: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Branch preservation behavior tests: savePartialProgress (repo/workspace naming, no-commits skip, collision idempotency same-SHA, collision different-SHA suffixed), preserveFailedLaneProgress (happy path, unsafeBranches for failed preservation with commits, error handling for missing branches)
- [ ] State contract tests: persistence round-trip with partialProgress fields present/absent, validation accepts/rejects correct types, serialization skips undefined fields
- [ ] Full test suite passes (`cd extensions && npx vitest run`) — 997/997 tests, 25/25 files
- [ ] R008: Fix flaky "no change when fields are identical" test — use fixed timestamps instead of Date.now()
- [ ] R008: Add integration tests with disposable git repos for savePartialProgress and preserveFailedLaneProgress (lane with commits → saved branch, no commits → skip, collision handling, unsafeBranches population)
- [ ] R008: Update STATUS.md test count evidence to match actual output

---

### Step 4: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** 🟨 In Progress

- [ ] Inline comments updated in worktree.ts, engine.ts, resume.ts, types.ts, persistence.ts for partial progress preservation
- [ ] Docs-impact decision: `/orch-status` output is summary-only (counts, phase, wave, elapsed) — does NOT expose saved branch names or per-task partial progress data. No docs/reference/commands.md update needed.
- [ ] Closeout evidence note recorded in Execution Log
- [ ] `.DONE` created

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `preserveBranch()` in worktree.ts already handles merge-path saved branches; partial progress uses different naming (`saved/{opId}-{taskId}-{batchId}`) vs merge-path (`saved/{originalBranch}`) | Use separate function for partial progress naming | worktree.ts |
| `LaneTaskOutcome` in types.ts needs new fields; `PersistedTaskRecord` also needs them for batch-state serialization | Step 2 scope | types.ts |
| `removeAllWorktrees()` already receives `targetBranch` for merge-path preservation; partial progress save should happen BEFORE worktree removal in the execution/cleanup flow, not during `removeWorktree` | Step 1 design consideration | execution.ts, worktree.ts |
| The partial progress save needs the base branch to count commits — this is the `baseBranch` captured at batch start, available in the execution flow | Step 1 | execution.ts |

## Notes

### Preflight Findings (Step 0)

**Cleanup call sites (Step 1 insertion points):**
1. `engine.ts:726` — `removeAllWorktrees()` in post-batch cleanup (end-of-batch). Uses `orchBranch` as targetBranch. This is the PRIMARY insertion point — partial progress save should happen BEFORE this cleanup.
2. `resume.ts:1410` — `removeAllWorktrees()` in resume terminal cleanup (section 11). Per-repo with per-repo targetBranch. Same pattern — save before cleanup.
3. `engine.ts:557` — `forceCleanupWorktree()` in inter-wave worktree reset failure path. This is for BETWEEN waves, not end-of-batch — partial progress save not needed here (task will be retried).
4. `resume.ts:1365` — `forceCleanupWorktree()` in resume pre-execution reset. Same as #3 — between-wave, not relevant.

**Key insight:** Partial progress preservation should happen BEFORE `removeAllWorktrees()` calls at batch end (sites #1 and #2), not during. We need to iterate over failed task outcomes, check each lane branch for commits ahead of base, and create saved branches BEFORE cleanup deletes them.

**Existing branch preservation compatibility:**
- `removeAllWorktrees()` already calls `removeWorktree()` → `ensureBranchDeleted()` → `preserveBranch()` which preserves branches with unmerged commits vs `targetBranch` as `saved/{originalBranch}`.
- TP-028 adds a DIFFERENT preservation: saving branches for FAILED tasks specifically, with task-ID-based naming (`saved/{opId}-{taskId}-{batchId}`).
- These are complementary, not conflicting. The existing merge-aware preservation handles success-path branch safety; TP-028 handles failure-path progress recovery.

**Naming alignment:**
- `diagnostics.ts` already has `partialProgressCommits: number` and `partialProgressBranch: string | null` in `TaskExitDiagnostic`.
- New fields on `LaneTaskOutcome` and `PersistedTaskRecord` should use the same names.
- Saved branch naming: `saved/{opId}-{taskId}-{batchId}` (repo mode) or `saved/{opId}-{repoId}-{taskId}-{batchId}` (workspace mode) per roadmap spec.

**Serialization path (Step 2):**
- `persistence.ts:serializeBatchState()` maps `LaneTaskOutcome` → `PersistedTaskRecord`.
- Add `partialProgressCommits` and `partialProgressBranch` to both types.
- The mapping in `serializeBatchState()` at line ~721 already handles optional fields pattern (see `repoId`, `resolvedRepoId`).
