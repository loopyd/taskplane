**Current Step:** Step 4: Tests
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-03
**Review Level:** 2
**Review Counter:** 7
**Iteration:** 1
**Size:** M

---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Read PROMPT.md and STATUS.md
- [x] Trace persistence task outcome flow
- [x] Trace resume reconciliation algorithm
- [x] Read PersistedSegmentRecord

### Step 1: Populate segments during execution
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Segment start → running
- [x] Segment complete → succeeded
- [x] Segment failure → failed + diagnostic
- [x] Persist in batch-state.json
- [x] Maintain activeSegmentId

### Step 2: Resume reconstruction
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Read persisted segments for frontier
- [x] Identify completed segments
- [x] Identify in-flight segments
- [x] Identify pending segments
- [x] Reconstruct DAG
- [x] Resume from first incomplete
- [x] R004: Preserve .DONE authority even when segment frontier is incomplete
- [x] R004: Fall back to task-level reconciliation when wave segment record is missing
- [x] R004: Add regression tests for .DONE authority + missing-segment fallback
- [x] R005: Preserve terminal task status when segmentIds exist but segments[] records are missing
- [x] R005: Add integration-order regression test (reconstructSegmentFrontier → reconcileTaskStates)

### Step 3: Reconciliation edge cases
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Mid-segment crash
- [x] Between-segment crash
- [x] All segments complete
- [x] Segment failure + dependents

### Step 4: Tests
**Status:** 🟨 In Progress
- [ ] Test segments in batch-state
- [ ] Test resume frontier reconstruction
- [ ] Test mid-segment crash resume
- [ ] Test between-segment crash resume
- [ ] Test repo-singleton unchanged
- [ ] Run full suite, fix failures

### Step 5: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] Update STATUS.md

## Notes
- R004 suggestion: keep fallback hardening in place before Step 3 edge-case implementation.
- R004 suggestion: add targeted unit coverage around `reconstructSegmentFrontier()` and `computeResumePoint()` fallback behavior.
- R005 suggestion: test `reconstructSegmentFrontier()` + `reconcileTaskStates()` in sequence for partial segment persistence.
