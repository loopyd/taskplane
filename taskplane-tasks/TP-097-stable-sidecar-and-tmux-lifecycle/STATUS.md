## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| sidecarPath/exitSummaryPath kept optional (not required) for backward compat | Design decision — reviewer/QG sessions auto-generate; only worker iterations need stable identity | `spawnAgentTmux()` signature |
| Stable key uses ORCH_BATCH_ID (not Date.now()) for orchestrated mode | Ensures same path across crash recovery within batch | `generateStableSidecarPaths()` |
