**Current Step:** Step 2: Engine validation
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-06
**Review Level:** 2
**Review Counter:** 1
**Iteration:** 1
**Size:** M

---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Read PROMPT.md and STATUS.md
- [x] Read spec sections 3, 3a, 4, 5, 6, 7
- [x] Read engine.ts segment frontier logic
- [x] Read resume.ts reconstruction
- [x] Understand segment lifecycle

### Step 1: Outbox consumption
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Check for request files after segment completes
- [x] Parse SegmentExpansionRequest
- [x] Handle malformed files (.invalid)
- [x] Discard on failed segment (.discarded)
- [x] Process in requestId order

### Step 2: Engine validation
**Status:** 🟨 In Progress
- [ ] Repo existence check
- [ ] Cycle detection
- [ ] Task not terminal
- [ ] Placement valid
- [ ] Idempotency guard

### Step 3: DAG mutation with rewiring
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] Formal rewiring algorithm (roots/sinks/S_old)
- [ ] after-current rewiring
- [ ] end placement
- [ ] Repeat-repo disambiguated IDs
- [ ] Re-topologize orderedSegments
- [ ] Update SegmentFrontierTaskState

### Step 4: Persistence and alerts
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] Persist new segments to batch state
- [ ] Update segmentIds[]
- [ ] Record processed requestId
- [ ] Emit supervisor alert
- [ ] Rename request file
- [ ] Worktree provisioning

### Step 5: Resume compatibility
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] Resume reconstructs expanded segments
- [ ] Approved-but-unexecuted expansion resumes
- [ ] Idempotency on resume

### Step 6: Testing & Verification
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] All mutation tests (linear, fan-out, end, repeat-repo)
- [ ] Rejection tests (unknown repo, cycle, duplicate)
- [ ] Edge cases (malformed, multi-request, idempotency)
- [ ] Resume after expansion
- [ ] Full test suite passing
- [ ] Polyrepo regression check

### Step 7: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] JSDoc
- [ ] Update STATUS.md
