---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Read PROMPT.md and STATUS.md
- [x] Read spec sections 3, 3a, 4, 5, 6, 7
- [x] Read engine.ts segment frontier logic
- [x] Read resume.ts reconstruction
- [x] Understand segment lifecycle

### Step 1: Outbox consumption
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Check for request files after segment completes
- [x] Parse SegmentExpansionRequest
- [x] Handle malformed files (.invalid)
- [x] Discard on failed segment (.discarded)
- [x] Process in requestId order
- [x] R002: consume sorted valid requests through a concrete boundary-processing path
- [x] R002: scope failed-segment discard to matching taskId/fromSegmentId only
- [x] R002: reject empty requestedRepoIds as malformed (.invalid)

### Step 2: Engine validation
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Repo existence check
- [x] Cycle detection
- [x] Task not terminal
- [x] Placement valid
- [x] Idempotency guard
- [x] Validation failure path: rename to .rejected and emit segment-expansion-rejected alert
- [x] Validation success path: hand off to graph-mutation path
- [x] Validation branch smoke coverage (reject + accept)

### Step 3: DAG mutation with rewiring
**Status:** 🟨 In Progress
- [ ] Formal rewiring algorithm (roots/sinks/S_old)
- [ ] after-current rewiring
- [ ] end placement
- [ ] Repeat-repo disambiguated IDs
- [ ] Re-topologize orderedSegments
- [ ] Update SegmentFrontierTaskState

### Step 4: Persistence and alerts
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] Persist new segments to batch state
- [ ] Update segmentIds[]
- [ ] Record processed requestId
- [ ] Emit supervisor alert
- [ ] Rename request file
- [ ] Worktree provisioning

### Step 5: Resume compatibility
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] Resume reconstructs expanded segments
- [ ] Approved-but-unexecuted expansion resumes
- [ ] Idempotency on resume

### Step 6: Testing & Verification
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] All mutation tests (linear, fan-out, end, repeat-repo)
- [ ] Rejection tests (unknown repo, cycle, duplicate)
- [ ] Edge cases (malformed, multi-request, idempotency)
- [ ] Resume after expansion
- [ ] Full test suite passing
- [ ] Polyrepo regression check

### Step 7: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] JSDoc
- [ ] Update STATUS.md

## Notes

- Reviewer suggestion (R002): consider extracting boundary outbox consumption into a dedicated helper for readability/testability.
- Reviewer suggestion (R004): keep Step 2 validation in `processSegmentExpansionRequestAtBoundary(...)` for ordering/scoping continuity.
- Reviewer suggestion (R004): consider validating request edges against requested repos before cycle checks for clearer rejection reasons.
