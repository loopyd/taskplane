**Current Step:** Step 5: Resume compatibility
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-06
**Review Level:** 2
**Review Counter:** 16
**Iteration:** 2
**Size:** M

---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Read PROMPT.md and STATUS.md
- [x] Read spec sections 3, 3a, 4, 5, 6, 7
- [x] Read engine.ts segment frontier logic
- [x] Read resume.ts reconstruction
- [x] Understand segment lifecycle

### Step 1: Outbox consumption
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Check for request files after segment completes
- [x] Parse SegmentExpansionRequest
- [x] Handle malformed files (.invalid)
- [x] Discard on failed segment (.discarded)
- [x] Process in requestId order
- [x] R002: consume sorted valid requests through a concrete boundary-processing path
- [x] R002: scope failed-segment discard to matching taskId/fromSegmentId only
- [x] R002: reject empty requestedRepoIds as malformed (.invalid)

### Step 2: Engine validation
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Repo existence check
- [x] Cycle detection
- [x] Task not terminal
- [x] Placement valid
- [x] Idempotency guard
- [x] Validation failure path: rename to .rejected and emit segment-expansion-rejected alert
- [x] Validation success path: hand off to graph-mutation path
- [x] Validation branch smoke coverage (reject + accept)

### Step 3: DAG mutation with rewiring
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Formal rewiring algorithm (roots/sinks/S_old)
- [x] after-current rewiring
- [x] end placement
- [x] Repeat-repo disambiguated IDs
- [x] Re-topologize orderedSegments
- [x] Update SegmentFrontierTaskState
- [x] Post-mutation scheduling continuity (expanded pending segments remain executable)
- [x] Step 3 scheduling continuity test intent (targeted coverage)

### Step 4: Persistence and alerts
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Persist new segments to batch state
- [x] Persist expansion provenance (`expandedFrom`, `expansionRequestId`) on new segment records
- [x] Update segmentIds[]
- [x] Record processed requestId
- [x] Crash-safe approval ordering: durable persistence + idempotency audit before `.processed` rename
- [x] Emit supervisor alert (include before/after segment lists)
- [x] Rename request file
- [x] Worktree provisioning
- [x] Step 4 approval-path persistence/lifecycle targeted test intent
- [x] R012: resync persisted segment dependency records after each approved mutation (multi-request same boundary) and cover with runtime test

### Step 5: Resume compatibility
**Status:** 🟨 In Progress
- [x] Resume reconstructs expanded segments
- [x] Expanded segments are behaviorally indistinguishable from original segments after resume (deps/lifecycle/metadata parity)
- [x] Approved-but-unexecuted expansion resumes
- [x] Idempotency on resume (processed request files/request IDs do not replay)
- [x] Step 5 resume-specific targeted test intent (approved-but-unexecuted + processed-file replay)
- [ ] R016: rebuild resume continuation rounds in grouped wave form (multi-task parity) and add multi-task/idempotency resume tests

### Step 6: Testing & Verification
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] All mutation tests (linear, fan-out, end, repeat-repo)
- [ ] Rejection tests (unknown repo, cycle, duplicate)
- [ ] Edge cases (malformed, multi-request, idempotency)
- [ ] Resume after expansion
- [ ] Full test suite passing
- [ ] Polyrepo regression check

### Step 7: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] JSDoc
- [ ] Update STATUS.md

## Notes

- Reviewer suggestion (R002): consider extracting boundary outbox consumption into a dedicated helper for readability/testability.
- Reviewer suggestion (R004): keep Step 2 validation in `processSegmentExpansionRequestAtBoundary(...)` for ordering/scoping continuity.
- Reviewer suggestion (R004): consider validating request edges against requested repos before cycle checks for clearer rejection reasons.
- Reviewer suggestion (R007): clarify `end` placement for multi-root inserts (terminals connect to all roots(N)).
- Reviewer suggestion (R007): keep re-topology tie-breaks deterministic (existing order + segmentId).
- Reviewer suggestion (R010): keep approval processing in the same boundary-processing path for deterministic ordering and file lifecycle handling.
- Reviewer suggestion (R012): preserve current crash-safe ordering (persist + idempotency audit before `.processed` rename) while fixing multi-request persistence correctness.
- Reviewer suggestion (R014): validate resume idempotency from persisted request-audit records (not mailbox filename state alone).
- Reviewer suggestion (R014): consider a multi-request same-boundary resume scenario so Step 4 R012 dependency resync remains correct after reconstruction.
- Reviewer suggestion (R016): add a multi-request same-boundary-before-restart scenario to validate grouped continuation-wave reconstruction end-to-end.
