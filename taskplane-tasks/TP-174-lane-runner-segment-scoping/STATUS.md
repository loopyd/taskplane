---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Read lane-runner.ts prompt construction and progress logic
- [ ] Read sidecar-telemetry.ts STATUS.md parsing
- [ ] Understand stepSegmentMap availability from TP-173
- [ ] Read spec sections A.2–A.5
- [ ] Document findings

---

### Step 1: Segment-Scoped Iteration Prompt
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Add helper `getRepoIdFromSegmentId(segmentId)` to extract repoId from segment ID
- [ ] Add helper `getStepsForRepoId(stepSegmentMap, repoId)` to get step numbers with segments for a given repoId
- [ ] Add segment-scoped prompt block: when stepSegmentMap exists and segmentId is present, inject segment context showing only current segment's checkboxes, listing other segments as "not yours", and filtering remaining steps to only those with this repoId
- [ ] Legacy fallback: when stepSegmentMap is undefined or segmentId is null, no change to prompt (backward compatible)
- [ ] Run targeted tests (48/48 pass)
- [ ] R002: Use `config.repoId` instead of parsing opaque segmentId; add fallback when repoStepNumbers is empty (legacy multi-segment without markers)

---

### Step 2: Segment-Scoped Progress and Stall Detection
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Replace full-task progress delta with segment-scoped delta when segment markers are present (use getSegmentCheckboxes from Step 1 already added)
- [ ] Stall detection uses segment-scoped prevChecked/afterChecked counts
- [ ] Corrective re-spawn prompt references segment-specific unchecked items
- [ ] Legacy fallback: no change to progress/stall when no markers
- [ ] Run targeted tests (48/48 pass)

---

### Step 3: Segment Exit Condition
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Use isSegmentComplete (already added in Step 1) in the step completion and loop exit logic to detect when all segment checkboxes are checked
- [ ] When segment is complete for current step: advance to next step if more steps for this repoId, or break loop if no more
- [ ] Legacy fallback unchanged — allComplete check uses full-task isStepComplete for non-segment tasks
- [ ] Run targeted tests (48/48 pass)

---

### Step 4: Sidecar Telemetry Update
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Update emitSnapshot() in lane-runner.ts to accept segment context and report segment-scoped checked/total in the snapshot progress when segment markers are present
- [ ] Legacy fallback: full-task progress for tasks without markers (emitSnapshot unchanged when no segment context)
- [ ] Updated dashboard/public/app.js to prefer V2 snapshot progress (segment-scoped) over full STATUS.md counts when available
- [ ] Run targeted tests (48/48 pass)

---

### Step 5: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending
- [ ] Run FULL test suite (3316/3317 pass, 1 failure)
- [ ] Fix engine-runtime-v2-routing.test.ts 5.3 regex to accept optional snapshotSegmentCtx param
- [ ] Add test: segment-scoped prompt shows only current segment's checkboxes (tests 4.1-4.6)
- [ ] Add test: segment-scoped progress counts only segment's checkboxes (tests 2.1-2.7, 5.1-5.4)
- [ ] Add test: stall detection uses segment-scoped delta (tests 5.1-5.4)
- [ ] Add test: segment exit condition detects completion correctly (tests 3.1-3.6, 6.1-6.4)
- [ ] Add test: legacy task without markers — no behavior change (tests 7.1-7.6)
- [ ] Final full test suite run — all 3363 tests passing

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| sidecar-telemetry.ts handles JSONL streaming, not STATUS.md progress — telemetry update goes in emitSnapshot within lane-runner.ts | Documented | lane-runner.ts |
| Dashboard progress bar was not consuming V2 snapshot progress (_v2Progress stored but unused) — wired it in dashboard/public/app.js | Fixed in Step 4 | dashboard/public/app.js |
| Dashboard server.cjs parseStatusMd does simple regex count of all checkboxes — not segment-aware; relying on V2 snapshot progress for segment-scoped display | Tech debt — could be revisited | dashboard/server.cjs |

## Notes

Depends on TP-173. Core Phase A task — this is what makes workers see only their segment.
Specification: docs/specifications/taskplane/segment-aware-steps.md

### Preflight Findings

**lane-runner.ts structure (1015 lines):**
- `executeTaskV2()` is the main function, taking `ExecutionUnit`, `LaneRunnerConfig`, `pauseSignal`
- Iteration loop: parse PROMPT+STATUS, find remaining steps, build prompt lines, spawn worker, check progress
- Prompt construction: lines 194-246 build `promptLines[]`, including segment DAG context and iteration warnings
- Progress: lines 326-351: `afterTotalChecked - prevTotalChecked` counts ALL checkboxes via `parseStatusMd`
- Stall detection: `noProgressCount` increments when `progressDelta <= 0` (ignoring soft progress from git diff)
- Step completion: marks steps complete via `isStepComplete()`, breaks loop when `allComplete`
- Post-loop: checks allStepsComplete, handles .DONE suppression for non-final segments (TP-145/165)

**sidecar-telemetry.ts (252 lines):**
- `tailSidecarJsonl()` parses JSONL events (message_end, tool_execution_start, etc.)
- Does NOT parse STATUS.md — progress reporting is in `emitSnapshot()` within lane-runner.ts
- Sidecar telemetry is about token counts, tool calls, retries — NOT checkbox progress
- The segment-scoped progress change needed is in `emitSnapshot()` in lane-runner.ts

**stepSegmentMap availability:**
- `unit.task.stepSegmentMap?: StepSegmentMapping[]` available on `ExecutionUnit.task` (ParsedTask)
- `StepSegmentMapping` has `{stepNumber, stepName, segments: SegmentCheckboxGroup[]}`
- `SegmentCheckboxGroup` has `{repoId, checkboxes: string[]}`
- Parsed by `parseStepSegmentMapping()` in discovery.ts
- If no segment markers in PROMPT.md, `stepSegmentMap` is undefined → legacy fallback

**Spec A.2-A.5 key rules:**
- A.2: Worker sees only current segment's checkboxes; remaining steps filtered to steps with this repoId
- A.3: Progress/stall counts only current segment's checkboxes (getSegmentCheckboxes)
- A.4: isSegmentComplete checks all segment checkboxes are checked; step advancement if more steps for repoId
- A.5: Sequential execution unchanged; segments still execute across waves

**Key design decision:** 
- `segmentId` format is `taskId::repoId` — we can extract repoId from it
- Need to parse STATUS.md for segment blocks (#### Segment: repoId) to count segment-specific checkboxes
- For prompt scoping, use `unit.task.stepSegmentMap` (from PROMPT.md parsing)
- For progress counting, parse STATUS.md directly (since worker modifies STATUS.md)
