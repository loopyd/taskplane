### Step 1: Segment-Scoped Iteration Prompt
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

> ⚠️ Hydrate: Expand based on lane-runner prompt structure found in Step 0

- [ ] Extract current segment's checkboxes from stepSegmentMap
- [ ] Inject segment context into prompt
- [ ] Filter remaining steps to current repoId
- [ ] Legacy fallback for tasks without markers
- [ ] Run targeted tests

### Step 2: Segment-Scoped Progress and Stall Detection
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

> ⚠️ Hydrate: Expand based on progress tracking structure found in Step 0

- [ ] Add getSegmentCheckboxes helper
- [ ] Segment-scoped progress delta

## Notes

Depends on TP-173. Core Phase A task — this is what makes workers see only their segment.
Specification: docs/specifications/taskplane/segment-aware-steps.md

### Preflight Findings

**lane-runner.ts structure (1015 lines):**
- `executeTaskV2()` is the main function, taking `ExecutionUnit`, `LaneRunnerConfig`, `pauseSignal`
- Iteration loop: parse PROMPT+STATUS, find remaining steps, build prompt lines, spawn worker, check progress
- Prompt construction: lines 194-246 build `promptLines[]`, including segment DAG context and iteration warnings
- Progress: lines 326-351: `afterTotalChecked - prevTotalChecked` counts ALL checkboxes via `parseStatusMd`
- Stall detection: `noProgressCount` increments when `progressDelta <= 0` (ignoring soft progress from git diff)
- Step completion: marks steps complete via `isStepComplete()`, breaks loop when `allComplete`
- Post-loop: checks allStepsComplete, handles .DONE suppression for non-final segments (TP-145/165)

**sidecar-telemetry.ts (252 lines):**
- `tailSidecarJsonl()` parses JSONL events (message_end, tool_execution_start, etc.)
- Does NOT parse STATUS.md — progress reporting is in `emitSnapshot()` within lane-runner.ts
- Sidecar telemetry is about token counts, tool calls, retries — NOT checkbox progress
- The segment-scoped progress change needed is in `emitSnapshot()` in lane-runner.ts

**stepSegmentMap availability:**
- `unit.task.stepSegmentMap?: StepSegmentMapping[]` available on `ExecutionUnit.task` (ParsedTask)
- `StepSegmentMapping` has `{stepNumber, stepName, segments: SegmentCheckboxGroup[]}`
- `SegmentCheckboxGroup` has `{repoId, checkboxes: string[]}`
- Parsed by `parseStepSegmentMapping()` in discovery.ts
- If no segment markers in PROMPT.md, `stepSegmentMap` is undefined → legacy fallback

**Spec A.2-A.5 key rules:**
- A.2: Worker sees only current segment's checkboxes; remaining steps filtered to steps with this repoId
- A.3: Progress/stall counts only current segment's checkboxes (getSegmentCheckboxes)
- A.4: isSegmentComplete checks all segment checkboxes are checked; step advancement if more steps for repoId
- A.5: Sequential execution unchanged; segments still execute across waves

**Key design decision:** 
- `segmentId` format is `taskId::repoId` — we can extract repoId from it
- Need to parse STATUS.md for segment blocks (#### Segment: repoId) to count segment-specific checkboxes
- For prompt scoping, use `unit.task.stepSegmentMap` (from PROMPT.md parsing)
- For progress counting, parse STATUS.md directly (since worker modifies STATUS.md)
