**Review Counter:** 0
**Iteration:** 4
**Size:** L

---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending

### Step 1: Worker spawn reliability (#335)
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Add post-spawn verification with retry
- [ ] Log failures for diagnosis

---

### Step 2: Lane-state reset on worker restart (#333)
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Reset stale fields before new worker spawn
- [ ] Write lane-state immediately

---

### Step 3: Telemetry accumulation across restarts (#334)
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Preserve and accumulate telemetry across iterations

---

### Step 4: Lane session stderr capture (#339)
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Redirect lane stderr to log file

---

### Step 5: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Behavioral tests for all four fixes
- [ ] Full test suite passing (3009/3009)

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Quality gate fix agent has its own workerToolCount=0 reset (separate lifecycle) | Preserved — fix agents are not worker iterations | extensions/task-runner.ts:3963 |
| Subprocess mode already accumulates tokens via += (no fix needed) | Confirmed by source extraction test | extensions/task-runner.ts:3505+ |
| extractFunctionRegion captures too much when functions aren't separated by section markers | Test used narrower region extraction | extensions/tests/crash-recovery-spawn-reliability.test.ts |
