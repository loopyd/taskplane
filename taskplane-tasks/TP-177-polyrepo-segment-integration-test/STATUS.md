# TP-177: Polyrepo Segment Integration Test — Status

**Current Step:** Step 4: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress (Steps 2-3 blocked)
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-13
**Review Level:** 0
**Review Counter:** 0
**Iteration:** 1
**Size:** M

---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Verify test workspace exists and is clean
- [x] Verify all 3 repos on initial state (shared-libs=develop, api-service=develop, web-client=develop)
- [x] Identify multi-segment tasks (TP-004: shared-libs→web-client, TP-005: shared-libs→api-service, TP-006: shared-libs→api-service+web-client)

---

### Step 1: Add Segment Markers to Test Tasks
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Update TP-004 PROMPT.md with segment markers
- [x] Update TP-005 PROMPT.md with segment markers
- [x] Update TP-006 PROMPT.md with segment markers
- [x] Update .reset-snapshots STATUS.md files (and PROMPT.md files)
- [x] Verify single-segment tasks unchanged (TP-001, TP-002, TP-003 have no segment markers)
- [x] Commit changes (shared-libs develop: c1a7941)

---

### Step 2: Run Polyrepo Batch
**Status:** 🟠 Partially Blocked
- [x] Reset workspace (workspace verified clean on develop branches)
- [ ] Run /orch all — BLOCKED: Cannot run orchestrator from worker agent context
- [ ] Monitor: no supervisor steering needed — BLOCKED
- [ ] All 6 tasks succeed — BLOCKED
- [x] Wrote 15 automated validation tests (segment-marker-validation.test.ts) — all pass
- [x] Full test suite passes (3378 tests, 0 failures)

---

### Step 3: Validate Results
**Status:** 🟠 Blocked (depends on Step 2)
- [ ] All .DONE files exist — BLOCKED (depends on Step 2)
- [ ] STATUS.md shows segment-scoped progress — BLOCKED
- [ ] No segment-related supervisor actions — BLOCKED
- [ ] Reasonable iteration counts — BLOCKED
- [ ] /orch-integrate succeeds — BLOCKED

---

### Step 4: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Document test results
- [x] Reset workspace (all 3 repos clean on develop branches)

| # | Type | Step | Verdict | File |
|---|------|------|---------|------|

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Worker agents cannot run orchestrator batches | Blocker for Steps 2-3 | STATUS.md Blockers |
| STATUS.md files don't use `## Steps` parent heading so `parseStepSegmentMapping` can't parse them directly | Expected behavior - parser designed for PROMPT.md | segment-marker-validation.test.ts |

## Execution Log

| Timestamp | Action | Outcome |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| 2026-04-12 | Task staged | PROMPT.md and STATUS.md created |
| 2026-04-13 17:31 | Task started | Runtime V2 lane-runner execution |
| 2026-04-13 17:31 | Step 0 started | Preflight |
| 2026-04-13 | Step 0 complete | Workspace verified, multi-segment tasks identified |
| 2026-04-13 | Step 1 complete | Segment markers added to TP-004/005/006 PROMPT.md + STATUS.md |
| 2026-04-13 | Validation tests | 15 tests written and passing, full suite 3378 pass |
| 2026-04-13 | Steps 2-3 blocked | Cannot run /orch all from worker agent context |
| 2026-04-13 | Step 4 complete | Results documented, workspace reset |

## Blockers

**Steps 2 and 3 require running the orchestrator (`/orch all`)**, which is an interactive supervisor command that cannot be invoked from a worker agent context. The orchestrator requires:
1. A pi interactive session with the taskplane extension loaded
2. A supervisor model loop to manage the batch
3. Multiple worker agents to be spawned in worktree lanes

A worker agent cannot start another orchestrator. **Recommended:** Run Steps 2-3 manually after this task merges, using `pi /orch all` from `C:\dev\tp-test-workspace\shared-libs\`.

---

## Notes

Acceptance test for Phase A. Depends on TP-173, TP-174, TP-175.
Tests against: C:\dev\tp-test-workspace\
Specification: docs/specifications/taskplane/segment-aware-steps.md section A.11

### Test Results Summary

**Automated validation (15 tests, all passing):**
1. Single-segment tasks (TP-001, TP-002, TP-003) have no segment markers — ✅
2. TP-004 PROMPT.md parses without errors, correct 2-segment mapping (shared-libs → web-client) — ✅
3. TP-005 PROMPT.md parses without errors, correct 2-segment mapping (shared-libs → api-service) — ✅
4. TP-006 PROMPT.md parses without errors, correct 3-segment fan-out mapping — ✅
5. All .reset-snapshot STATUS.md files have matching segment markers with checkboxes — ✅
6. Full test suite regression: 3378 tests, 0 failures — ✅

**Segment marker format verified:**
- `#### Segment: shared-libs` / `#### Segment: web-client` / `#### Segment: api-service`
- Each segment has checkboxes grouped beneath
- Steps with single-repo work have exactly 1 segment
- Steps with multi-repo work have correct segment-per-repo split
- Documentation/Delivery steps use packet repo (shared-libs)

**End-to-end batch run (Steps 2-3):**
- BLOCKED: Cannot run `/orch all` from worker agent context
- Requires manual execution: `pi /orch all` from `C:\dev\tp-test-workspace\shared-libs\`

### What Was Delivered
1. Segment markers added to TP-004, TP-005, TP-006 PROMPT.md (live + .reset-snapshots)
2. Matching STATUS.md segment structure in .reset-snapshots
3. 15 automated validation tests in `extensions/tests/segment-marker-validation.test.ts`
4. Committed to shared-libs develop branch (c1a7941)
