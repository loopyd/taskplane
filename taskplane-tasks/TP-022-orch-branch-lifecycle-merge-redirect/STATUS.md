**Current Step:** None
**Status:** Pending
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-18
**Review Level:** 2
**Review Counter:** 0
**Iteration:** 7
**Size:** L

---

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Read `engine.ts` — batch execution phases, wave loop, cleanup
- [ ] Read `merge.ts` — merge flow, fast-forward, stash/pop
- [ ] Read `waves.ts` — `resolveBaseBranch()`, `allocateLanes()`
- [ ] Read `persistence.ts` — orchBranch serialization
- [ ] Read `resume.ts` — audit all baseBranch routing (worktree base, merge target, reset, cleanup)
- [ ] Read `messages.ts` — understand completion message patterns for Step 4
- [ ] Verify TP-020 and TP-021 artifacts present
- [ ] Map baseBranch call sites → orchBranch migration decisions (log in Discoveries)
- [ ] Identify impacted test files for resumed-batch and merge coverage (orch-state-persistence, merge-repo-scoped, monorepo-compat-regression, worktree-lifecycle, orch-pure-functions)
- [ ] R002: Fill in explicit test file paths in Notes "Impacted Test Files" section
- [ ] R002: Deduplicate Reviews table and Execution Log rows

---

### Step 1: Create Orch Branch at Batch Start
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Generate orch branch name `orch/{opId}-{batchId}` using `resolveOperatorId(orchConfig)` and create via `runGit(["branch", orchBranch, baseBranch], repoRoot)`; store in `batchState.orchBranch`
- [ ] Handle creation failure: set phase="failed", endedAt, push error, notify, return (matching existing early-exit pattern in engine.ts)
- [ ] Log branch creation via `execLog("batch", batchId, "created orch branch", { orchBranch, baseBranch })`
- [ ] R003: Clean duplicate Execution Log rows in STATUS.md
- [ ] R004: Move orch branch creation after preflight+discovery, or add best-effort cleanup on all planning-phase early exits that occur after branch creation
- [ ] R004: Add tests for orch branch creation (success path, failure path, cleanup on early exit)

---

### Step 2: Route Worktrees and Merge to Orch Branch
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] In engine.ts: pass `orchBranch` (not `baseBranch`) to `executeWave()` and `mergeWaveByRepo()` calls
- [ ] In engine.ts: post-merge worktree reset targets `orchBranch` (not `baseBranch`)
- [ ] In resume.ts: add orchBranch empty-guard — fail fast with clear message if `batchState.orchBranch` is empty/missing on resume
- [ ] In resume.ts: pass `orchBranch` to `executeWave()` and `mergeWaveByRepo()` calls (4 call sites: re-exec merge, wave executeWave, wave mergeWaveByRepo, and re-exec merge target)
- [ ] In resume.ts: post-merge worktree reset targets `orchBranch` (not `baseBranch`)
- [ ] Verify `resolveBaseBranch()` compatibility — in workspace mode it detects per-repo branch; in repo mode it returns passed-in value (now orchBranch). No changes needed.
- [ ] Add tests for orchBranch routing: engine execute/merge/reset, resume parity, resolveBaseBranch repo vs workspace mode (added to orch-direct-implementation.test.ts, tests 5-8)
- [ ] Remove duplicate R004 review row in STATUS.md
- [ ] R006: Fix orchBranch guard in resume.ts — move guard before runtime state mutation (phase/batchId), or set terminal phase + endedAt + error before returning, so state remains consistent and future /orch-resume is not blocked
- [ ] R006: Add workspace-mode fallback handling in resolveBaseBranch() — fail fast with targeted message when fallback would be an orch branch in a non-primary repo (detached HEAD + no defaultBranch)
- [ ] R006: Add test for legacy-state guard path verifying runtime state is resumable/consistent after rejection
- [ ] R006: Add workspace-mode test for resolveBaseBranch() fallback with detached HEAD when batchBaseBranch is an orch branch

---

### Step 3: Replace Fast-Forward with update-ref in Merge
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Replace ff-only+stash/pop block with rev-parse+update-ref: get temp branch HEAD via `git rev-parse`, update target branch ref via `git update-ref`, with proper error handling (failedLane/failureReason set on failure, exec logging for success and failure)
- [ ] Add non-regression verification: no `git merge --ff-only` or `git stash` calls remain in merge flow
- [ ] Add Step 3 tests to orch-direct-implementation.test.ts: success path (update-ref called, no ff-only/stash), failure path (update-ref error → failedLane/failureReason set, status partial/failed)
- [ ] Clean up duplicate R006 review row in STATUS.md
- [ ] R008: Gate update strategy — detect if targetBranch is checked out in repoRoot; if yes, use checkout-safe advancement (merge --ff-only); if no, use update-ref. Update comment to reflect workspace-mode reality.
- [ ] R008: Use compare-and-swap update-ref (`update-ref <ref> <new> <old>`) to guard against concurrent branch movement
- [ ] R008: Add workspace-mode merge test — simulate repoId present + target branch checked out, verify post-merge advancement doesn't leave repo dirty

---

### Step 4: Auto-Integration and Cleanup
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Add ORCH_MESSAGES helper for post-batch integration guidance (shared by engine.ts + resume.ts)
- [ ] Implement auto-integration in engine.ts Phase 3: gated ff of baseBranch to orchBranch (success → log+notify, diverged/detached/dirty/missing → warn+preserve orchBranch, never fail the batch)
- [ ] Update engine.ts cleanup: do NOT delete orchBranch; lane branches deleted as before; unmerged-branch protection uses orchBranch (lanes merged into orchBranch, not baseBranch)
- [ ] Update engine.ts completion notification to include orchBranch integration info
- [ ] Resume parity: mirror auto-integration + cleanup + completion messaging in resume.ts section 11
- [ ] Add Step 4 tests: auto-integration success, auto-integration divergence fallback, manual mode preserves orchBranch, completion message content, resume parity structural checks (tests 18-23 in orch-direct-implementation.test.ts, 753 tests pass)
- [ ] R010: Verify resume.ts cleanup already resolves per-repo target branch in workspace mode (check if already implemented)
- [ ] R010: Gate auto-integration and manual guidance in engine.ts to terminal phases only (exclude paused/stopped)
- [ ] R010: Gate auto-integration and manual guidance in resume.ts to terminal phases only (parity)
- [ ] R010: Add regression tests — no auto-integration/guidance when phase is paused/stopped (engine + resume)
- [ ] R010: Add test for resumed workspace-mode cleanup across multiple repos verifying lane branches are deleted against correct per-repo target branch
- [ ] R010: Extracted shared attemptAutoIntegration to merge.ts — both engine.ts and resume.ts now import from single source, eliminating parity drift

---

### Step 5: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Full test suite passes: `cd extensions && npx vitest run` — 21 files, 753 tests passed
- [ ] Orch branch creation edge cases verified: success path (test 5), branch-already-exists failure (test 6), lifecycle ordering after all planning exits (test 7), detached-HEAD rejection before creation (test 7b) — all pass
- [ ] Merge advancement: non-checked-out path uses update-ref with CAS (tests 11-13, 15-16); checked-out fallback uses ff-only+stash (test 14, 17) — both paths verified in merge.ts:775-835
- [ ] Worktrees based on orchBranch: engine.ts passes batchState.orchBranch to executeWave (L275) and mergeWaveByRepo (L384); tests 5-8 verify
- [ ] Post-merge worktree reset targets orchBranch: engine.ts L512, cleanup L698 both use batchState.orchBranch; tests 5-8 verify
- [ ] Cleanup preserves orchBranch in manual-integration mode: engine.ts only deletes lane branches (not orchBranch), cleanup uses orchBranch for unmerged detection (test 21), manual guidance shown via orchIntegrationManual (test 20, 22)
- [ ] Auto-integration verified: ff success (test 18), divergence fallback (test 19), update-ref non-checked-out (test 23), shared attemptAutoIntegration function gates both paths (test 22)
- [ ] Resume parity: terminal-phase gating (test 24), orchBranch guard consistency (tests 7, 9), resolveBaseBranch fallback (test 10), workspace-mode cleanup (test 25), inter-wave reset (test 26) — all pass
- [ ] All failures fixed — no failures found (753/753 tests pass, 21/21 test files pass)
- [ ] R012: Add detached-HEAD test for orch branch creation edge case — verify engine.ts fails fast before branch creation when on detached HEAD (test 7b added, 753/753 pass)
- [ ] R012: Deduplicate review/log rows in STATUS.md

---

### Step 6: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Resolve R012 debt: add detached-HEAD test for orch branch creation + deduplicate STATUS.md review/log rows
- [ ] Reconcile STATUS.md audit consistency (single canonical review timeline, no duplicate rows)
- [ ] Verify discoveries are logged
- [ ] Create `.DONE` file

## Notes

### Impacted Test Files (Step 5 reference)
- `extensions/tests/orch-state-persistence.test.ts` — baseBranch/orchBranch serialization, v1→v2 upconvert, round-trip tests
- `extensions/tests/waves-repo-scoped.test.ts` — resolveBaseBranch() tests (likely no changes needed)
- `extensions/tests/orch-pure-functions.test.ts` — resolveBaseBranch, state serialization with baseBranch
- `extensions/tests/worktree-lifecycle.test.ts` — baseBranch in createWorktree calls (no change: worktree code is unchanged)
- `extensions/tests/monorepo-compat-regression.test.ts` — orchBranch field in state fixtures
- `extensions/tests/merge-repo-scoped.test.ts` — merge flow tests (may need update for update-ref vs ff-only)

### baseBranch → orchBranch Migration Summary
- **engine.ts**: 3 sites migrate to orchBranch (executeWave, mergeWaveByRepo, post-merge reset). Phase 3 cleanup keeps baseBranch.
- **merge.ts**: ff-only replaced with update-ref, stash/pop removed. targetBranch parameter receives orchBranch from caller.
- **resume.ts**: 4 sites migrate to orchBranch (mirrors engine.ts). Cleanup keeps baseBranch.
- **waves.ts**: No changes needed. resolveBaseBranch() receives orchBranch in repo mode.
- **persistence.ts**: orchBranch serialization already present from TP-020.
