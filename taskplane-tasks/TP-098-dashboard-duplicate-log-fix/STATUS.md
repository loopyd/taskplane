### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Read dashboard log rendering and STATUS.md parsing

---

### Step 1: Fix duplicate execution log (#348)
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] In `executeTask`: distinguish first start (totalIterations===0) from restart — log "Task resumed" on re-entry instead of duplicate "Task started"
- [ ] In step-marking block: skip "Step N started" log when step is already in-progress (avoids duplicate on restart)
- [ ] In iteration loop: use `state.totalIterations` (global) instead of `iter + 1` (local) for "No progress" and "Iteration summary" log messages to prevent label collision across restarts
- [ ] Add targeted test: verify single executeTask call produces exactly one "Task started" entry
- [ ] Add targeted test: verify re-entry (totalIterations > 0) produces "Task resumed" instead of "Task started"
- [ ] Add targeted test: verify step already in-progress does not produce duplicate "Step N started"

---

### Step 2: Wiggum legacy cleanup (#251)
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Remove .wiggum-wrap-up references from task-runner.ts
- [ ] Remove .wiggum-wrap-up references from abort.ts
- [ ] Search for any other legacy references and remove from templates/agents/task-worker.md

---

### Step 3: Testing & Verification
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Full test suite passing (3131 tests, 0 failures)

---

### Step 4: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** Pending

- [ ] Log discoveries

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Root cause: task-runner logs "Task started" and "Step N started" on every executeTask call, including restarts. On re-entry, executeTask re-logs startup entries because there's no first-start vs resume distinction. Additionally, iter+1 (loop-local) causes label collisions across restarts (e.g., two "Iteration 1" entries) | Fix in task-runner.ts | extensions/task-runner.ts:3033,3053,3191,3239 |
| Dashboard renderStatusMd is correct — no client-side duplication bug | Confirmed | dashboard/public/app.js |
| Server parseStatusMd is correct — no server-side duplication | Confirmed | dashboard/server.cjs |
