### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Read `monitorLanes()` in `execution.ts`
- [x] Read `resolveTaskMonitorState()` — understand grace periods
- [x] Read `detectOrphans()` and `markOrphansCrashed()` in `process-registry.ts`
- [x] Verify test baseline

---

### Step 1: Wire orphan detection into the monitor poll loop
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Add orphan detection block after liveness registry refresh
- [x] Wrap in try/catch — monitor loop must never throw
- [x] Refresh cache after marking orphans

---

### Step 2: Fast-fail on dead PID + stale snapshot
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Read existing grace period logic carefully
- [x] **AMENDED (R003)**: Target is `else` branch (`snap.taskId === taskId`), NOT null/mismatch branch. That branch does `sessionAlive = snap.status === "running"` unconditionally — the bug — because if the worker died silently the snapshot still says "running" and Priority 3 never fires.
- [x] Implement fast-fail in the `else` branch: when `snap.updatedAt` stale > stallTimeoutMs/2 AND trackerAgeMs >= 60s AND isV2AgentAlive returns false, set sessionAlive = false
- [x] Only applies after startup grace (trackerAgeMs >= 60s)
- [x] Null-guard snap.updatedAt to avoid false positives from old schema

---

### Step 3: Verify supervisor/operator visibility
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Confirm read_agent_status / list_active_agents reflect crashed status
- [x] Trace failed task path through monitor loop to engine failure handling

---

### Step 4: Testing & Verification
**Status:** 🟨 In Progress

- [ ] Full test suite passing
- [ ] CLI smoke passing
- [ ] Fix all failures

---

### Step 5: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] Inline comments for new logic
- [ ] Discoveries logged
