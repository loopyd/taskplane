### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Read PROMPT.md and STATUS.md
- [x] Read config-schema.ts defaults
- [x] Read settings-tui.ts thinking fields
- [x] Read lane-runner.ts and agent-host.ts thinking handling
- [x] Read task-runner.ts fallback patterns
- [x] Grep for thinking fallbacks across codebase

### Step 1: Fix defaults to inherit
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Worker thinking "off" → "" (inherit)
- [x] Reviewer model hardcode → "" (inherit)
- [x] Normalize "inherit" to "" in config-loader
- [x] Update templates
- [x] Verify existing configs unaffected

### Step 2: Audit and fix runtime fallbacks
**Status:** ✅ Complete
- [x] Check lane-runner.ts thinking fallback
- [x] Check agent-host.ts flag passing
- [x] Check task-runner.ts /task path
- [x] Check merge.ts (verify v0.24.18 wiring)
- [x] Verify empty thinking = session inheritance

### Step 3: Thinking picker in /taskplane-settings
**Status:** 🟨 In Progress
- [ ] Change thinking fields to picker control
- [ ] Options: inherit/on/off
- [ ] Reuse selectScrollable
- [ ] Current value marked with ✓
- [ ] Save to correct destination
- [ ] Suggest enabling thinking when model changes to a thinking-capable model

### Step 4: Testing & Verification
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] Test empty thinking = no flag
- [ ] Test "inherit" normalization
- [ ] Test thinking picker save/load
- [ ] Test reviewer model inheritance
- [ ] Run full test suite

### Step 5: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
- [ ] Update config docs
- [ ] Update STATUS.md

## Notes

- Reviewer suggestion (R005): keep picker persistence explicit so selecting “inherit” stores/clears as `""` rather than a literal label.
- Reviewer suggestion (R005): keep the same picker UX pattern across worker/reviewer/merge thinking fields.
