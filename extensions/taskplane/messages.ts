/**
 * Resume an interrupted batch from persisted state.
 *
 * Flow:
 * 1. Load and validate batch-state.json
 * 2. Check phase eligibility (paused/executing/merging only)
 * 3. Check for alive TMUX sessions and .DONE files
 * 4. Reconcile persisted state against live signals
 * 5. Compute resume point (which wave to start from)
 * 6. Reconstruct runtime state and continue execution
 *
 * @param orchConfig     - Orchestrator configuration
 * @param runnerConfig   - Task runner configuration
 * @param cwd            - Repository root
 * @param batchState     - Mutable batch state (will be populated from persisted state)
 * @param onNotify       - Callback for user-facing messages
 * @param onMonitorUpdate - Optional callback for dashboard updates
